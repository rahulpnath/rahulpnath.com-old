<p><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/2017-recap/">Another year</a> has gone by so fast, and it is again time to do a year review.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>

<p>2018 saw most of my time in running, cycling and learning to swim. Regular exercise and healthy eating helped <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/">maintain my weight</a>. Lots of travel added to the excitement. Blogging, Reading, Photography and Open source took the back seat and did not go as planned.
Looking forward to 2019!</p></blockquote>

<h3>What went well</h3>

<h4><strong>Running, Cycling and Learning to Swim</strong></h4>

<p>As planned last year I did two half marathon events - <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1495400703">Brisbane Great South Run</a> and <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1628202657">Springfield Half Marathon</a>. I could also do a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1756881573/overview">Sub 50 10k</a> run after many tries. Even though running a marathon was part of one of the goals it did not happen. Cycling was on and off, and towards the year end, I started commuting to work (around 10k one way). However, it lasted only around 2 months as I changed client, for which I had to commute to Gold Coast (around 70km, once a week). With swimming, I still struggle to do more than two laps at a stretch. The goal was to swim 1km by the end of 2018 but looks like that&rsquo;s a long way to go. I was often lazy and not motivated to go out to the pool to practice.</p>

<p>I can spend all this time on these activities because of the full support from my wife <a href="https://www.facebook.com/parvathy.panicker">Parvathy</a>.</p>

    <img src="/images/2018_sport.jpg" alt="Year in Sport" />
</a></p>

<h4><strong>Travel</strong></h4>

<p>We covered a couple of major tourist destinations around Australia - Great Barrier Reef (Cairns), <a href="https://rahulpnath.com/blog/ndc-security-2018-overview-and-key-takeaways/">Gold Coast</a>, Frazer Island and Tasmania being the top highlights. We also did a lot of hikes and short trips around Brisbane including Tin Can Bay and Ballina. Snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef, Penguin Tour in Tasmania, Whale watching, beach highway drive, and 7 seater beach flight in Frazer Island, dolphin feeding at Tin Can Bay, Croc attack show at Hartley&rsquo;s Crocodile Park were some of the new experiences in life and enjoyed it a lot.</p>

<h4><strong>Community</strong></h4>

<p>I did two public talks, one at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Brisbane-Net-User-Group/events/251639570/">.Net User Group</a> on Azure Key Vault and one at Readify Back2Base on <a href="https://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/ok-i-have-got-https-what-next/">Ok I Have Got HTTPS! What Next?</a>. Two is still a smaller number and is something I want to do more of in the coming years.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018_talks_ug.jpg" alt="Talk at .Net User Group" class="center" /></p>

<p>I created a youtube pip video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7EPrlpPqXw">Key Vault Connected Service</a>, and wanted to do couple more of such videos but did not get prioritized enough over the other things.
The significant open source contribution was to <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/MicrosoftConfigurationBuilders/commits?author=rahulpnath">KeyVault configuration builder</a> that is part of the ASP.Net framework.</p>

<h3>What didn&rsquo;t go well</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blogging</strong> Blogging took a back seat this year, even though I had set out to do 4 posts a month. I did a total of 29 posts that&rsquo;s roughly over 2 posts a month. Some months I missed out on it completely.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/2018_postpermonth.jpg" alt="Posts per month in the year 2018" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reading</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/13036464">20 books</a> was the goal for this year however ended up reading only 6 books. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821042-80-20-running">80/20 Running</a> helped me a lot with my running.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Source</strong> I wanted to involve with one Open Source project actively, but the only thing that happened was some minor contributions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning</strong> Most of the learning was at work, and I did not actively take up learning anything new. I did start with Category Theory and FSharp again, but it did not stick for a long time.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Goals for 2019</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reading</strong> Read 10 books</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blogging</strong> 2 posts a month and stay consistent all months</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tri Sports</strong> Complete a Marathon, couple of half marathon event, at least one cycling event and 500m swim.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning</strong> Become more proficient with JavaScript. Build <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/keyvaultexplorer">Azure Key Vault Explorer</a> while learning.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I have been on and off my <a href="https://rahulpnath.com/blog/experimenting-with-pomodoro-technique/">planning</a> and <a href="https://rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">routines</a>. Looking to get back with this and organize my day-to-day activities a bit more and be more accountable for the goals that I have set.</p>

<p>Wishing you all a Happy and Prosperous New Year!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/2016-recap/">A year</a> has gone by so fast, and it is again time to do a year review.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>

<p>2017 was the transformation year. Regular exercise and healthy eating helped <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/">loose around 20 kilos</a>. Lots of travel and blogging made it an excellent year. Reading, Photography and Open source did not go that great. Looking forward to 2018!</p></blockquote>

<h3>What went well</h3>

<h4><strong>Blogging</strong></h4>

<p>It has been both good and a bad year as far as this blog. Including the &lsquo;<a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/tipow/">Tip of the Week</a>&rsquo; series I wrote seventy-six posts this year with an average of over six posts per month. This is the good part, as it is well past the goal of a <em>minimum four posts a month</em> goal set last year. But looking at the actual posts per month graph below, it is clear that I have fallen short of it on an actual month by month basis. Up until August, I had a steady stream of posts coming in, from when it started dropping down, with even months (November) with no posts. Mainly it&rsquo;s my laziness to blame, but I can also tell reasons like Vietnam trip, Shifting to Brisbane, etc.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2017_postpermonth.png" alt="Posts per month in the year 2017" /></p>

<h4><strong>Running</strong></h4>

<p>I had started running towards the end of December 2016. One of my goals for 2017 was running, and it has had a good improvement. Ran over 750 kilometers including a half marathon. I am yet to participate in any running events and am planning to in the coming year. I have also started cycling, and it is an excellent way to cross train.</p>

<p><a href="https://2017.strava.com/en-us/videos/92aff78b819c502351b85b8ef27e35025cd97adf/">
    <img src="/images/2017_sport.jpg" alt="Year in Sport" />
</a></p>

<h4><strong>Travel</strong></h4>

<p>Did our first international holiday to Vietnam for ten days and was a great experience. Also went around Australia visiting Blue Mountains, Canberra, Port Macquarie, Brisbane and lots of <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/one-day-trips-around-sydney/">one-day trips around Sydney</a>. Mandarin Picking, Strawberry picking and Whale watching were some of the top activities for the year.</p>

<p><img src="/images/strawberyy_picking.jpg" alt="Strawberry Picking, Ricardoes" /></p>

<h3>What didn&rsquo;t go well</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reading</strong> Had set out with a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/5493-2017-reading-challenge">goal of 21 books</a> but ended up finishing only ten books. Of the books I read liked <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322">Mindset</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/1439167346/">How to Win Friends and Influence People,</a> was the best.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Photography</strong>
One trip every three months and post photos were one another goal. The travel part went good (see above), but my DSLR always remained in the bag. Except for a few pictures on the phone camera, there was not much photography done.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FSharp</strong>
FSharp was again on and off this year. Apart from a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/todoist-template-transformer-transform-tasks-to-x-days-from-now/">small utility that I created for Todoist</a>, I did not do much F# work.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Goals for 2018</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blogging</strong> Stick to 4 posts a month. Need to get back on schedule.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Running</strong> Attend few running events. Run a marathon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Swimming</strong> Having started cycling along with running, has got me thinking about a triathlon. The only thing between is swimming, and I have no clue how to swim. Learning to swim is one of the key goals for the upcoming year. Target is to be able to swim one km.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Source</strong> Start working on a side project. Need to find a matching project first.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reading</strong> Read 15 books</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Wishing you all a Happy and Prosperous New Year!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/review-pixel/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/review-pixel</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to mobile phones, I used to be a gadget freak and buy the latest phone as soon as it arrives in the market. But not after I got the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/">Nexus 5</a>. It&rsquo;s been well over three years now and not even once did I want to switch over to something else. The phone never slowed down over these years, and the battery lasted enough for the day. I broke the Nexus screen a couple of months back and was forced to switch over to a new phone. I didn&rsquo;t have to do much market research or phone comparisons this time; as I just knew which one to pick up.</p>

<p><a href="https://madeby.google.com/intl/en_au/phone/">The Pixel, Phone By Google!</a></p>

<p><img src="/images/pixel.png" alt="Pixel" class="center" /></p>

<h4><strong>Key Features</strong></h4>

<p>The Pixel is the first phone in the Google Pixel hardware line and is a successor to the Nexus range of devices. The Pixel runs <a href="https://www.android.com/intl/en_au/versions/nougat-7-0/">Android-Nougat</a> with some features exclusive to it. The Pixel is very much comparable to the Nexus, with improved hardware and latest software. Below are some of the key features that I like about the phone.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fingerprint sensor</strong> The fingerprint sensor on the back allows you to unlock the phone and specific apps and also authorize purchases. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/password-manager-get-one-if-you-havent-already/">1Password</a> is integrated with the sensor which enables me to unlock it using the sensor. I no longer need to type in my long master password every time I use 1Password.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Camera</strong> <em>Pixel takes brilliant photos in bright light, low light, and any light.</em> The camera is awesome and at times is a good replacement for your <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/photography-learning-to-click/">DSLR</a>. With Pixel, Google also provides unlimited original quality storage for all photos and videos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google Assistant</strong> Pixel is the first phone with the <a href="https://assistant.google.com/">Google Assistant</a> built-in. It helps you manage tasks, find content on phone and the internet, perform actions, etc. just like Siri or Cortana. I have not used the assistant much and yet to find some valid use cases.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4><strong>Apps</strong></h4>

<p> Some of the apps that I use regularly are</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/todoist-manage-your-todo-list/">Todoist</a>: My ToDo List</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/feedly-one-stop-reading-place/">Feedly</a>: For all my RSS feeds</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/pocket-offline-reading-made-easy/">Pocket</a>: For offline reading and read later</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/password-manager-get-one-if-you-havent-already/">1Password</a>: Password Manager</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/buffer-smarter-social-sharing/">Buffer</a>: To schedule articles to all social networks</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/rescue-time-track-your-time/">Rescue Time</a>: Automatically tracks where I spent time on mobile</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/three_months_to_a_half_marathon/">Strava, Runtastic &amp; Garmin Connect</a>: Tracking my runs and exercises</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle">Kindle</a>: Reading kindle books</li>
<li>Twitter, Whatsapp, Messenger, Instagram, Skype &amp; Yammer :Social Networking apps</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/optimizing-octopress-workflow-for-new-posts/">JotterPad</a>: Write articles for blog in markdown format</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-to-setup-google-indic-keyboard-on-your-android-phone/">Google Indic Keyboard</a>: Writing in my native language</li>
<li>Gmail &amp; Outlook: Emails</li>
<li>Youtube: Videos</li>
</ul>


<h4><strong>Case </strong></h4>

<p>I am using the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/spigen-awesome-phone-cases/">Spigen Neo Hybrid</a> case for Pixel. It adds extra weight to the phone, but I am used to it from my Nexus as well. The Neo Hybrid provides military grade protection and protects the phone from most falls.</p>

<p>Overall I have found the Pixel a good phone and recommend it to anyone looking out for a new phone now. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is also of the same range (slightly costlier) and worth considering if you are not too particular about having a vanilla Android experience. Which phone do you use?</p>

    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/spigen-awesome-phone-cases</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are looking to get a case for your phone, then check out cases by <a href="https://www.spigen.com/">Spigen</a>. I have been using Spigen cases for over three years, and I totally recommend it.</p>

<p>Spigen cases are made with premium materials and are slim, sleek and simple. Spigen provides various models that match different needs. The cases provide <a href="https://www.spigen.com/pages/military-grade">Military Grade Protection</a> and protect the phone from most falls.</p>

<p>The first Spigen cases I got was for my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/">Nexus 5</a>. The Neo Hybrid lasted for over three years. With the Spigen cases, the Nexus was well protected. It did fall from my hands many times, and every time the case protected it well enough. A couple of months back the Spigen case broke, and I had been using the phone without a cover since then. Unfortunately, during one of my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/three_months_to_a_half_marathon/">morning runs</a> the phone fell from my hands while slipping it into the armband. Without the Spigen to protect it, the Nexus screen broke at the corners.</p>

<p><img src="/images/spigen_pixel.png" alt="Spigen Neo Hybrid for Pixel" class="center" /></p>

<p>A month back I switched over to Google Pixel as the Nexus was becoming unusable with the broken screen. I got the <a href="https://www.spigen.com/collections/pixel/products/google-pixel-case-neo-hybrid?variant=29248762049">Spigen NeoHybrid for Pixel</a>. The case provides dual layer protection with TCU and PC bumper and comes with fingerprint resistance. The precise cutouts give easy access to all buttons and fingerprint sensor.</p>

<p>If you are looking to a get a case, check out if <a href="https://www.spigen.com/">Spigen</a> has one for your model!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/2016-recap/"/>
    <updated>2016-12-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/2016-recap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.oldlaundrytheatre.co.uk/happy-new-year-from-all-at-the-old-laundry/">
<img class="center" alt="Posts per month - 2016" src="/images/happy_new_year.png"/>
</a></p>

<p>2016 was a great year and I thought sharing some of the things that went well, those that didn&rsquo;t and setting goals for 2017.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>

<p><em>2016 was a great year and is the first one where I am writing a &lsquo;year in review&rsquo; post. Blogging, Videos, Open Source and Community contribution are some of the things that went well. FSharp, Reading, Travel, Photography and Exercise did not go that great. Looking forward to 2017 and planning to keep the goodness of 2016 and add some more to it</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>What went well</h3>

<h4><strong>Blogging</strong></h4>

<p>This has been a great year with my blog. On an average, I published four blog posts a month. It started with a self-challenge from March to write every day. I was able to come up with eight posts that month, but then felt it was not something that I could stick with consistently. So I kept a target of four posts per month and stuck to it for the rest of the year. I automated a lot of mundane tasks in my blogging workflow right from <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/optimizing-octopress-workflow-for-new-posts/">creating draft posts</a> to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/continuos-delivery-of-octopress-blog-using-travisci-and-docker/">deploying posts</a> and <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/automatic_deployment_of_future_posts_with_octopress/">scheduling posts for future deployment</a>. This has saved a lot of time for me and helps me stick just with the writing part of blogging!</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Posts per month - 2016" src="/images/2016_postspermonth.png"/></p>

<p>Sticking with <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/maintaining-a-blogging-schedule/">publishing posts on a regular interval</a> was more about deciding that I have to write every day. I set a &lsquo;mini habit&rsquo; to write every day - at least one line every day - and stuck to it. This helped me get over the initial inertia of starting to write a post. Having set this goal to myself I had to consistently come with topics to blog about. This very much changed the way that I approached <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">my day job</a>. I always involved in it with the need to find something to share, in a way that I can abstract it out from the business dependencies. Most of the decisions and issues that happened to us (the development team) are now documented here. This acts as a documentation for any new joiners and makes the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/make-it-easy-for-the-new-person-joining-your-team-have-a-project-ramp-up-plan/">ramp up to the project a bit easier</a>. More than anything it definitely helps me find the solution when I come across the same issue again. So if you still don&rsquo;t have a blog of your own, there is no better time than now. Make it a new year resolution. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/own-your-urls/">Get a URL</a> and start writing. I have also been successful in getting a couple of people (at least four that I personally know of) to blog. Getting started is the biggest hurdle, the rest will fall in the due course of time.</p>

<h4><strong>Youtube Channel</strong></h4>

<p>Starting a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RahulNath">Youtube channel</a> had been something I wanted to do for a long time. I have just got started with it and posted one video. I now understand why people say recording is hard - there is a lot to it and it takes time to be good at it. The only way to get better if something is hard is to do more of it - <em><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FrequencyReducesDifficulty.html">Frequency Reduces Difficulty</a></em> I plan to start with one video per month and see how it goes. I have been procrastinating on the second video for a while, <strike>will see if I can get it out before this year!</strike> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbshGF4ZwGE">Got it out just in time!</a></p>

<h4><strong>Open Source and Forums</strong></h4>

<p>Contributing to Open Source projects is a good way to learn. I have always struggled to find projects/issues to contribute to. But then I learned that it is again just a matter of deciding and committing to. <a href="http://www.firsttimersonly.com/">First Timers only</a> a good way to find issues and projects that one can possible jump right into. I decided to start looking at projects that I use more on a day to day basis - Asmspy and Autofixture were something that interested me. There were a couple of open issues in AsmSpy, that I picked up and <a href="http://mikehadlow.com/">Mike Hadlow</a> was more than happy to merge them in. I also decided to set up <a href="https://github.com/mikehadlow/AsmSpy/issues/14">Chocolatey package for AsmSpy</a>. On Mike&rsquo;s request, I now manage the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/asmspy/">chocolatey package account</a> and am a contributor on AsmSpy project. I automated the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/automated-deployment-of-asmspy-to-chocolatey-using-appveyor/">deployment pipeline for AsmSpy</a> so that I do not have to worry about deploying the chocolatey package every time a change is made. Also got to <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/issues?q=mentions:rahulpnath+is:closed">contribute to a few issues with AutoFixture</a> which is managed by <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/">Mark Seemann (ploeh)</a>. I was also lucky enough to meet him in person at <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/ndc-sydney/">NDC Sydney</a>.</p>

<p>I keep a look at the <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=AzureKeyVault">Azure Key Vault MSDN forum</a> and try to help every time a question comes up. Answering questions on forums is also a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-in-the-learning-loop/">good way to learn</a>, find interesting problems and <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/stars-do-count/">at times rewarding</a>.</p>

<h3>What didn&rsquo;t go well</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>FSharp</strong>: Learning FSharp is something that I really want to, but it&rsquo;s not been happening that well. I am on and off with this and it keeps getting sidelined.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reading</strong>: Compared to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/3539650">2015</a> my reading has been a lot down in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/5380726">2016</a>. Though I have been listening to a lot more podcasts, I think I have to get back on with reading in the coming year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Travel &amp; Photography</strong>: There&rsquo;s not been much travel except for the long vacation back home and a few local places in Sydney. Though I have been clicking along I was lazy to process them. There are still lying on my camera waiting to be processed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Getting enough exercise is something that I have really lacked last year and I think I have also put up some weight because of it. Except for the walk up and down from home to station for the office commute, there&rsquo;s not been much of my body moving.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Goals for 2017</h3>

<blockquote><p><em>In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.</em></p>

<p>― Dwight D. Eisenhower</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blogging</strong>: Stick to at least four posts per month. Try to see if I can get up to 6-8. I will have to improve the time that I take to write a post for this. Handling images for the blog needs to be automated as I spent some time converting and optimizing them.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>: Create a schedule for publishing videos and improve the quality and delivery of the videos.</li>
<li><strong>Reading</strong>: Set up a reading plan and read at least 21 books (1 more than what I did in 2015).</li>
<li><strong>FSharp</strong>: Learn, Contribute and Blog</li>
<li><strong>Travel &amp; Photography</strong>: One trip at least once in 3 months and post photos</li>
<li><strong>Exercise</strong>: Run/Bike at least once a week.</li>
</ul>
