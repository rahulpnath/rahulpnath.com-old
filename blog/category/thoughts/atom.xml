</a></p>

<p>2016 was a great year and I thought sharing some of the things that went well, those that didn&rsquo;t and setting goals for 2017.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>

<p><em>2016 was a great year and is the first one where I am writing a &lsquo;year in review&rsquo; post. Blogging, Videos, Open Source and Community contribution are some of the things that went well. FSharp, Reading, Travel, Photography and Exercise did not go that great. Looking forward to 2017 and planning to keep the goodness of 2016 and add some more to it</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>What went well</h3>

<h4><strong>Blogging</strong></h4>

<p>This has been a great year with my blog. On an average, I published four blog posts a month. It started with a self-challenge from March to write every day. I was able to come up with eight posts that month, but then felt it was not something that I could stick with consistently. So I kept a target of four posts per month and stuck to it for the rest of the year. I automated a lot of mundane tasks in my blogging workflow right from <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/optimizing-octopress-workflow-for-new-posts/">creating draft posts</a> to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/continuos-delivery-of-octopress-blog-using-travisci-and-docker/">deploying posts</a> and <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/automatic_deployment_of_future_posts_with_octopress/">scheduling posts for future deployment</a>. This has saved a lot of time for me and helps me stick just with the writing part of blogging!</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Posts per month - 2016" src="/images/2016_postspermonth.png"/></p>

<p>Sticking with <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/maintaining-a-blogging-schedule/">publishing posts on a regular interval</a> was more about deciding that I have to write every day. I set a &lsquo;mini habit&rsquo; to write every day - at least one line every day - and stuck to it. This helped me get over the initial inertia of starting to write a post. Having set this goal to myself I had to consistently come with topics to blog about. This very much changed the way that I approached <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">my day job</a>. I always involved in it with the need to find something to share, in a way that I can abstract it out from the business dependencies. Most of the decisions and issues that happened to us (the development team) are now documented here. This acts as a documentation for any new joiners and makes the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/make-it-easy-for-the-new-person-joining-your-team-have-a-project-ramp-up-plan/">ramp up to the project a bit easier</a>. More than anything it definitely helps me find the solution when I come across the same issue again. So if you still don&rsquo;t have a blog of your own, there is no better time than now. Make it a new year resolution. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/own-your-urls/">Get a URL</a> and start writing. I have also been successful in getting a couple of people (at least four that I personally know of) to blog. Getting started is the biggest hurdle, the rest will fall in the due course of time.</p>

<h4><strong>Youtube Channel</strong></h4>

<p>Starting a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RahulNath">Youtube channel</a> had been something I wanted to do for a long time. I have just got started with it and posted one video. I now understand why people say recording is hard - there is a lot to it and it takes time to be good at it. The only way to get better if something is hard is to do more of it - <em><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FrequencyReducesDifficulty.html">Frequency Reduces Difficulty</a></em> I plan to start with one video per month and see how it goes. I have been procrastinating on the second video for a while, will see if I can get it out before this year!</p>

<h4><strong>Open Source and Forums</strong></h4>

<p>Contributing to Open Source projects is a good way to learn. I have always struggled to find projects/issues to contribute to. But then I learned that it is again just a matter of deciding and committing to. <a href="http://www.firsttimersonly.com/">First Timers only</a> a good way to find issues and projects that one can possible jump right into. I decided to start looking at projects that I use more on a day to day basis - Asmspy and Autofixture were something that interested me. There were a couple of open issues in AsmSpy, that I picked up and <a href="http://mikehadlow.com/">Mike Hadlow</a> was more than happy to merge them in. I also decided to set up <a href="https://github.com/mikehadlow/AsmSpy/issues/14">Chocolatey package for AsmSpy</a>. On Mike&rsquo;s request, I now manage the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/asmspy/">chocolatey package account</a> and am a contributor on AsmSpy project. I automated the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/automated-deployment-of-asmspy-to-chocolatey-using-appveyor/">deployment pipeline for AsmSpy</a> so that I do not have to worry about deploying the chocolatey package every time a change is made. Also got to <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/issues?q=mentions:rahulpnath+is:closed">contribute to a few issues with AutoFixture</a> which is managed by <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/">Mark Seemann (ploeh)</a>. I was also lucky enough to meet him in person at <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/ndc-sydney/">NDC Sydney</a>.</p>

<p>I keep a look at the <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=AzureKeyVault">Azure Key Vault MSDN forum</a> and try to help every time a question comes up. Answering questions on forums is also a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-in-the-learning-loop/">good way to learn</a>, find interesting problems and <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/stars-do-count/">at times rewarding</a>.</p>

<h3>What didn&rsquo;t go well</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>FSharp</strong>: Learning FSharp is something that I really want to, but it&rsquo;s not been happening that well. I am on and off with this and it keeps getting sidelined.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reading</strong>: Compared to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/3539650">2015</a> my reading has been a lot down in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/5380726">2016</a>. Though I have been listening to a lot more podcasts, I think I have to get back on with reading in the coming year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Travel &amp; Photography</strong>: There&rsquo;s not been much travel except for the long vacation back home and a few local places in Sydney. Though I have been clicking along I was lazy to process them. There are still lying on my camera waiting to be processed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Getting enough exercise is something that I have really lacked last year and I think I have also put up some weight because of it. Except for the walk up and down from home to station for the office commute, there&rsquo;s not been much of my body moving.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Goals for 2017</h3>

<blockquote><p><em>In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.</em></p>

<p>â€• Dwight D. Eisenhower</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blogging</strong>: Stick to at least four posts per month. Try to see if I can get up to 6-8. I will have to improve the time that I take to write a post for this. Handling images for the blog needs to be automated as I spent some time converting and optimizing them.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>: Create a schedule for publishing videos and improve the quality and delivery of the videos.</li>
<li><strong>Reading</strong>: Set up a reading plan and read at least 21 books (1 more than what I did in 2015).</li>
<li><strong>FSharp</strong>: Learn, Contribute and Blog</li>
<li><strong>Travel &amp; Photography</strong>: One trip at least once in 3 months and post photos</li>
<li><strong>Exercise</strong>: Run/Bike at least once a week.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/solve-the-business-problem-dont-mimic-the-process/"/>
    <updated>2016-12-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/solve-the-business-problem-dont-mimic-the-process</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.dhc-gmbh.com/en/kompetenzen/business-process-management/"><img class="center" alt="Business" src="/images/business_problem_automation.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>While working with clients I often get into conversations with the domain experts and people involved directly with the business. The discussions usually happen around what the process they are currently doing and how to automate those. Knowing the business process is helpful but getting influenced by that to design the solution is often not effective. Recently our team was in a conversation with a domain expert for a new feature request.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
The series of events mentioned below were modified to fit into the conversational style used in the post.
</div>


<blockquote><p><em><strong>Domain Expert</strong> We need to charge customers a processing fee if they pay using an electronic payment method. Depending on the type of card (mastercard, visa etc) the processing charge percentage differs. The processing fees are always charged in the subsequent billing period after their current payment. For e.g. if a customer pays 1000$ for the month of November, then his December bill will have 2% card processing charge in the December invoice</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Team</strong> That sounds easy, think we have enough details to get started on this. Thank you.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Domain Expert</strong> Perfect. Ahhh&hellip; Before you go, I think this can be a <a href="http://hangfire.io/">hangfire job</a> that runs on 29 every month, a few days before the billing date, 3rd, and generate these charges for the client. This is what we do manually at present. (And walks off)</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Team</strong> Discussing amongst themselves the team agreed that creating a recurring job is the way to go. Based on the assumption that this job will be run only once a month, the job was to read all the invoices from 29th of the previous month till 28th of the current month and charge the clients. The meeting was dismissed and off went everyone busy to get the new feature out</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Business has Exceptions</h3>

<p>Problems started coming up the immediate month of feature deployment. Below is the sequence of events that happened.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>29th</strong> : Nice work, team! The processing charges have been applied as expected.</li>
<li><strong>30th</strong> : Some of the invoices have wrong data. We have deleted them. Can you run the job?</li>
<li><strong>2nd</strong> : A few of our clients (as usual) paid late and we need to charge their processing fees. Can you run the job?</li>
<li><strong>15th</strong> : One of our clients is ending tomorrow, so we need to send them an invoice and it should include the processing fees for their last payment. Can you run the job?</li>
</ul>


<p>But wait! We had decided that we will run this job only once a month and that is the only time we need to process the charges. We cannot run that job over and over again.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>What Iâ€™ve noticed over the years is that our users find very creative ways to achieve their business objectives despite the limitations of the system that theyâ€™re working with. We developers ultimately see these as requirements, but they are better interpreted as <strong>workarounds</strong>.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>- <a href="http://udidahan.com/2013/04/28/queries-patterns-and-search-food-for-thought/">Udi Dahan</a></em></strong></p></blockquote>

<p>The business was right when it said that <em>&lsquo;This is what we do manually at present.</em> What they did not say though is that there were always exceptions. And in these cases, they did the same process, but just for those exceptions. Business process mostly will be around the majority of the cases and the exceptions always get handled ad-hoc. So for the business it&rsquo;s always that which takes a good part of their time that matters more.</p>

<h3>Finding the Way Out</h3>

<p>The problem, in this case, was that the team modeled the solution exactly as the business did manually. Think kind of a solution is most likely to fail in case of exceptions. The human brain can easily deal with these exceptions. But for a program to solve it that way it needs to be told so, which implies that there need to be alternate flow paths defined. So with the improved understanding of these exception cases, the team does another analysis through the problem. After some discussion the team re-defines their original problem statement - *We need to be able to run the job any number of times and it should have the same effect.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>A payment should get </em>one and only one<em> processing charge associated, no matter however times it is seen by the job.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>With the new implementation, we decided to maintain a list of payments (a strong identifier that does not change) we have seen and processed. So every time a payment is seen, it is matched to see if it is already processed. If a charge is not already applied, a charge is applied and added to the list of processed payments. This ensures that they can run the job anytime. The team added in capability to specify the time range to look for invoices. By default, this ranged from 29th - 28th. The team also added in a way to void out payment charges applied, so that whenever the invoices changed then can just clear that off and re-run the job. These changes gave the flexibility to meet the businesses exception cases.</p>

<h3>Idempotent</h3>

<blockquote><p><em>The term <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/IdempotentReceiver.html">idempotent</a> is used in mathematics to describe a function that produces the same result if it is applied to itself, i.e. f(x) = f(f(x)). In Messaging this concept translates into a message that has the same effect whether it is received once or multiple times. This means that a message can safely be re-sent without causing any problems even if the receiver receives duplicates of the same message.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Being idempotent is what we missed with the first implementation. There was an assumed &lsquo;idempotency&rsquo; that the job will be run only once a month. But this constraint is not something that the code had control of and something it could enforce. The job was also not idempotent at the granular level that it was affecting - payments. Asserting idempotency at the batch level fails when we want to re-run batches (when exceptions like the wrong invoice happens). Idempotency should be enforced at the unit level of change, which is what maintaining a list of processed payments helps with. Any payment that is not processed before will get processed now when the job is run. We can also ensure that the payment will only be processed at most once.</p>

<p>This is just an example where we fail to see beyond the business problem and also see the computing problems accompanying it. Not always will it be easy and fast to rewrite the code. Even if we fail to see these problems the business will eventually make us to. But it is when we can see the computing problems that accompanies a business problem that we start becoming better developers. Applying basic computing principles, probing the domain expert during discussions, sitting with domain experts while they work etc. are all good ways to start seeing the untold business processes. Hope this helps the next time you are into a meeting with domain expert or solving a business problem.</p>

    <updated>2016-11-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-in-the-learning-loop</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The current state of the IT industry demands one to be constantly on the go and learning something new. New technologies, frameworks, languages etc. are getting released almost every other day. It is easy to get overwhelmed with all this information. The best way to keep up is to ignore most of it. But every now and then you would want to learn something new either because of project demands or out of personal interests. It is important to have a learning plan for yourself and stick through with it when wanting to learn something. If not it&rsquo;s easy to get distracted. These are some of the ways how I try to structure my learning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/media/keeleuniversity/lpdc/images/LPDC-Banner-Blue.jpg">
<img  alt="Make writing a habit - write daily" src="/images/learning_continuosly.png"/>
</a></p>

<h4><strong>Choosing and Sticking to a Topic</strong></h4>

<p>The most important thing in learning something new is to decide on what to learn. This could either be driven by work needs or personal interests. It&rsquo;s easier when driven by work needs as you do not have much to choose on. But still, you need to make sure that you stay within the boundaries of what you are trying to learn. It&rsquo;s easy to get off track as there might be a lot of things that come up which you are not aware of. At times understanding things with a certain level of abstraction is important. Just like social networks distracting you off from real work, different terminologies can get you off on a different path. So make sure you always stick to your end goal.</p>

<h4><strong>Books, Blogs, Videos</strong></h4>

<p>There are different ways that you can learn something new. It could either be books, videos, podcasts, blogs etc. There is no such thing as the best mode to learn. Mode of learning is person specific. So don&rsquo;t try to just imitate what your friend does. Try to find what works for you the best. Whenever I am learning something new, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/language-agnostic-books-for-every-developer-2/">books</a> work the best. Books give a structured approach to a new topic and eases your way through the topic. Though I have a Kindle, for technical books I <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/ebook-or-hard-copy/">prefer hard copies</a>. Often I find the need to refer back or forward a few pages and it feels best on a physical book.  I find blogs useful for learning more about a topic that I already have some idea about. For getting an overview of topics and interesting things I find videos and podcasts useful. So depending upon the need I mix and match these different learning modes.</p>

<p><img alt="Current Reading List" src="/images/learning_books.jpg"/></p>

<h4><strong>Open Source Projects, Forums, Demo application</strong></h4>

<p>It is important that you try out whatever your learn. There are different ways that you can learn by doing and depends on the individual. When learning a new topic I choose to come up with a sample application to be built using the new technology that I am learning. I created <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/picfinity/9wzdncrdwxx8">Picfinity</a> when I was learning Window 8 Modern applications. Once comfortable with a topic I choose to either answer <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/stars-do-count/">questions on forums</a> (mostly <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/rahul%20p%20nath?type=forum&amp;referrer=http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=AzureKeyVault">msdn</a> or <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/2205373/rahul-p-nath">stack overflow</a>). Contributing to open source projects is also another approach to gets some hands-on experience. Contributing to open source projects also helps the community and improves your self-confidence. <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> is a good place to start with open source contribution.</p>

<h4><strong>Freelancing</strong></h4>

<p>Not always you get to implement what you learn at your work. Implementing in real world projects is an important aspect of learning. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-freelancing-jobs-online/">Freelancing</a> is a good way to get work in areas that you want to improve or learn. Bid for projects that uses technologies that you are learning. It might be hard to get offered projects on technologies that you have no prior experience with. Showcasing any sample applications that you have built while learning increases your chances of getting the job. I used Picfinity to show that I can build Windows 8 and phone applications. This landed me opportunities to build different windows phone and windows 8 application.</p>

<h4><strong>Blog</strong></h4>

<p>Sharing your learnings helps improve your own understanding of the topic. It also helps others taking your same path and learning the new topic. Each one of us has a different perspective of understanding and learning things. So don&rsquo;t worry if you are writing about something that is already been written about. Make sure you blog your learnings and if you are new to blogging then there is no better time to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/blogging/">get started</a>. Blogs act as a good resume when applying for a job.</p>

<p>With new technologies and frameworks coming up every other day it is hard to keep up with all of them. It is not necessary to understand everything that is out there. What is important is that you should be able to learn quickly when the need arises. Also keep yourself aware of the changes in the industry and technologies you use. It does not matter if you do not know all the latest technologies. What matters is how fast you can learn a new concept. Have a learning plan! What do you find the most effective way to learn? Sound off in the comments</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/"/>
    <updated>2016-08-16T05:00:35+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Humans are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdGbHY9VKVM">creatures of habit</a> and things work well if made as a routine. It&rsquo;s what you build as your daily plan that defines what you end up achieving in the day and in turn with life.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>If you are a late night person, you can read &lsquo;morning&rsquo; as &lsquo;late night&rsquo; - the focus here is routine!</em></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/coffee-cup-notebook-pen-64775/">
<img  alt="Win your day, create a morning routine" src="/images/morning_routine.jpg"/>
</a></p>

<p>A morning routine is nothing but a sequence of actions regularly followed. I have tried switching my routine too, to late in the night a few times but found that mornings work better for me. But this could be different for you, so stick to the time of day that works for you. Before going to how my morning routine looks like (which I just started a week back), I will explain how I made the plan for the routine.</p>

<h3>Brain Dump</h3>

<p>At any point in time, there are a lot of things in my mind and things that I kept committing to myself and others. It is not possible to keep up with everything that I wish to do. So the very first thing to do is to dump everything out onto to paper and then decide what needs attention. The <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mind_Sweep_Trigger_List.pdf">Incompletion Trigger List</a> assists to get everything out of your mind onto paper. It&rsquo;s a good idea to block some time of yours to perform this exercise and give it all the attention it needs. At times it helps to <strong><em>Slow Down to Go Fast</em></strong>.</p>

<p><img  alt="Slow down, to go faster" src="/images/morningroutine_slow_down.jpg"/></p>

<h3>Most Important Task (MIT)</h3>

<p>If you are following along, hope the brain dump helped to flush out all that was there in your mind. This exercise needs to be occasionally done (maybe every 2-3 months) to stay clear and stay on top of things. I was sure that I could not do everything on that list after the brain dump. Now comes the hard part of choosing what matters to you and choosing those that aligns well with your goals. For the morning routine, I stuck to items from the brain dump that fall under &lsquo;Personal Projects&rsquo; category (as highlighted in the below image).</p>

<p><img  alt="Choosing tasks for morning routine" src="/images/morning_routine_MIT.png"/></p>

<p>These are the items that matter to me and aligns to the short-long term goals that I have. Below is a part of my list.</p>

<pre><code class="text">Start Youtube channel
Become Pluralsight Author
Blogging
Learn Functional Programming
Learn Ruby
Open Source Contribution
Improving Writing Skills and Language
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p><em>The key is not to prioritize whatâ€™s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.</em></p>

<p><em>â€“ <strong>Stephen Covey</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Progressing towards all of these items on the list at the same time is not possible, as time available each day for achieving them is limited. I usually get around 2-3 hours a day of &lsquo;me time&rsquo;, provided I wake up at 4 in the morning (more on this shortly). The number of hours you have might differ, and you could choose those many items as you think you can fit in. But 3 is a good number to choose, as that helps to mix in a few different goals and gives the flexibility to shuffle around with them on a day. For me, it also means I roughly get around 40-60 minutes daily, for each item.</p>

<p>Currently, the ones that I have in my morning routine are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Learn Functional Programming</li>
<li>Open Source Contribution</li>
</ul>


<h3>MITs to Mini Habits</h3>

<p>Having high-level short-long term goals is good, but does not provide anything actionable on a daily basis. It feels overwhelming to approach them because it does not give any sense of direction. So it&rsquo;s important that I have small actionable items that I can work on and progress towards achieving the goal.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Break your goal into the smallest possible task that you can think of so that you don&rsquo;t feel to skip it</em></p></blockquote>

<p>For me, the mini habits look like this</p>

<ul>
<li>Write at least one sentence for the blog</li>
<li>Read at least one line about Functional Programming</li>
<li>Read at least one line of code of an Open Source Project</li>
</ul>


<p>The idea behind keeping it so small is just to start. It&rsquo;s very rare that I have stopped writing after writing a sentence or stopped reading after a line. The trouble is only with getting started - once done you can easily carry on for at least 20-30 minutes. Even if I make 2 out of the 3 of the above tasks, I take it as a success, which gives me some flexibility each day.</p>

<h3>Waking up Tricks</h3>

<p>There are days when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_(creativity)">Resistance</a> beats me to it, and I don&rsquo;t get up to the routine. But I feel low on those days for not able to progress on my goals. So I try hard to have less of such days.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Alarm Phone Inside Pillow:</strong> I use <a href="http://www.bitspin.ch/">Timely</a> on a spare phone to set alarms.  Till a while back I used to keep the phone at the bedside while sleeping. But I noticed that I often ended up snoozing the alarm, at times even without full consciousness. So to make I <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/waking-up-early-is-all-about-waking-up-to-an-alarm/">wake up to the alarm</a>, I now keep the phone buried inside my pillow with just the vibration. The vibration forces me to wake up and also removes the need for any alarm sound - my kid and wife does not get disturbed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wear a Sweater:</strong> During winter, at times the cold beat me to it. It&rsquo;s hard to leave all the blankets and wake up to the cold. I started sleeping with the sweater, and I don&rsquo;t feel that cold when I wake up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationalize Against Resistance:</strong> However hard I try not to rationalize on getting up when the alarm sounds off, looking at the snooze button I end up rationalizing. Often I have found that when I try to use the tasks that I can achieve if I wake up, to motivate myself, I end up justifying that it can wait for tomorrow. Because there is no hard deadlines or accountability to anyone - it&rsquo;s just me!. Now I try just the opposite - Think about the resistance that is trying to force me to the bed and reassure myself that I should not fall to it. The &lsquo;me&rsquo; waking up after sleeping in is not going to like it then. So wake up!</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>My Routine</h3>

<ol>
<li><em>Wake at 4 am</em></li>
<li><em>Brush</em></li>
<li><em>Drink Water</em></li>
<li><em>Stretching</em></li>
<li><em>Review the tasks for the day (<a href="https://en.todoist.com/">Todoist</a>)</em></li>
<li><em>Mini Habits (2 or 3)</em></li>
<li><em>Wake up wife at 5:45 am</em></li>
<li><em>Continue Mini Habits (2 or 3)</em></li>
<li><em>Tea</em></li>
<li><em>Wake up Gautham at 7 am</em></li>
</ol>


<p>Having a morning routine has helped me focus more on things that matter and not wander from one task to another. It has also helped set a sense of direction to what I do every day and spent less time in thinking what to do. I find my days starting in gradually and not rushing into it, setting up the pace for the day. Hope this helps you too!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a year since I have moved over to <a href="https://readify.net/">Readify</a> in Sydney, Australia. Like I never believed that one could <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-freelancing-jobs-online/">earn money on the Internet</a>, I never thought that I could easily find a job abroad.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>If you are not a developer this post might not be fully applicable to you. However the things that helped me might help you too.</em></p></blockquote>

</a></p>

<p>I was not so keen to move abroad with an on-site opportunity from India, given the overhead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_delivery_model">onsite-offshore coordination</a> is a pain. Getting a  resident visa for countries like Australia, Canada etc. and finding a job after moving in was another option. I didn&rsquo;t prefer that either, as ending up in a foreign country without a job didn&rsquo;t look great to me, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/life-learnings-after-being-a-parent/">especially with Gautham</a>. So the only option left was to find an employer who recruits internationally and move in with a sponsored work visa. There are a lot of companies that are looking for people across the world and ready to sponsor for the visa . Since there is more money and effort involved in the whole process of recruiting internationally, I have felt that companies look for something more than just passing an interview process. Here are a few things that helped me find such an employer and things that I could have done better.</p>

<h3>The Third Place</h3>

<p>There needs to a place other than <strong>Home</strong> and <strong>Work</strong>,  where you spend time and this is often referred to as a <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheDeveloperTheoryOfTheThirdPlace.aspx">Third Place</a>. It could be your <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/blogging/">blog</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1948745/rahul-p-nath">stack overflow</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/stars-do-count/">msdn forums</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath">GitHub</a>, podcast, YouTube channel, social media pages etc. For me primarily it is this blog and then GitHub and a bit of <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/rahul%20p%20nath?type=forum&amp;referrer=http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/home">msdn forums</a>. Having a Third Place increases your chances of landing a job and also acts as a good &lsquo;Resume&rsquo;. I feel a resume is not worthy these days, as you can put whatever you feel like in that and needs to be validated through an interview. A blog, forum profile etc cannot be faked and always speaks about your experience.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>There is no reason to believe in a Resume, it can always be faked - but a history of events, posts or articles is hard to be faked. A resume should self-validate.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>A resume, if at all it needs to be there, should be just a highlight of all your experiences, with relevant links to your &lsquo;Third Place&rsquo;. This also helps keep resume short and clear.</p>

<h3>Using Social Media For The Advantage</h3>

<p>Social media is a really powerful to connect with different people, especially Twitter and LinkedIn. These are good channels to establish relationships with different people from different geographies. It&rsquo;s good to follow and start general conversations with employees of companies that you wish to join. Try to get involved with any tweets, messages, open source projects that they are also involved in . With time, once you become known to them, either you can reach out to them for an opportunity to work together or they themselves might offer you one. Don&rsquo;t try to fake it or overdo this, as it can affect you adversely. Do this only if you are genuinely interested in what they do.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="The Hague - Amsterdam" src="/images/amsterdam_thehague.jpg" title="One day in Amsterdam" /></p>

<p>For me, I landed an interview with <a href="https://www.evision-software.com/">eVision</a>, through one of my Twitter contact, <a href="https://twitter.com/randompunter">Damian Hickey</a>. it just happened that we followed each other and he worked for eVision, and I found the company interesting. Just a message to him and 2 months later I was in Amsterdam attending an interview with them and an offer for employment a week later. But I ended up not joining them because of the visa getting delayed for a long period as I was not fully &lsquo;travel ready&rsquo; (more on this below). But I enjoyed every bit of the time I spend with &lsquo;<em>Team Tigers</em>&rsquo; in eVision.</p>

<h3>Reaching out to Companies Directly</h3>

<p><a href="https://readify.net/">Readify</a> was another company that interested me. The company itself took pride in its employees and values a lot in their Professional development. The different people that were part of the company was another reason that I like Readify - MVPs, Book authors, Pluralsight authors, bloggers, musicians, photographers - name it and there was a person with that interests. It is also one of the <a href="https://readify.net/about-us/awards-recognitions/">best consulting companies</a> in Australia. The recruitment process was straightforward and all started with the <a href="https://knockknock.readify.net/">knock-knock challenge</a>, followed by a <a href="https://readify.net/careers/apply-now/technical-consultants/">series of interviews</a>. Everything just fell in place and on time and I ended up joining them and moving over to Sydney Australia on a work visa. Readify is still hiring and if you are interested and find yourself a match send me your profile (for no reason but to earn me the referral bonus) - if not head off to the knock knock challenge.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Good developers are in great demand and &lsquo;Good&rsquo; is relative - you have a place out there all you need is to reach out!</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Look out for companies in LinkedIn or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs?location=Sydney%2C%20Australia">StackOverflow Careers</a> who sponsor visa and follow their recruitment process.</p>

<h3>Being Travel Ready</h3>

<p>As I mentioned above one of the reasons not to take up the offer at eVision, was because of the visa getting delayed for a long period. Since all my documents are from India, I had to get all my documents attested and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostille_Convention">Apostille&rsquo;d</a>, which takes around a month&rsquo;s time. Added to that neither I nor my wife had a birth certificate (as it was not so common thing in my place when I was born). So I had to first get all the documents and then get them apostilled, which was not to happen in at least 2-3 months. Even if you have no interest in moving abroad,get all your travel documents and keep them ready.
Most commonly asked for documents are</p>

<ul>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>Birth certificate</li>
<li>Education certificates</li>
<li>Work Experience certificates</li>
<li>Marriage certificate (if you are married)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Making the Move</h3>

<p>One of the biggest challenges that I faced while making the move, was to get around the currency conversion and to ensure that the same standard of living can be maintained once I move across it. Sites like <a href="https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living">Expatistan</a>, <a href="http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/">Numbeo</a> etc. help give an idea on approximate costs. But what&rsquo;s worked for me more is to not use the actual <a href="http://www.xe.com/">currency exchange rate</a>, but to find a &lsquo;<strong>Personal Exchange Rate</strong> (PER)&rsquo; and use that to compare.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Personal Exchange Rate is your Disposable Income in Home Country/Disposable Income in Destination Country. Multiply costs of items in destination country by PER to see how it compares to prices in your country.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" alt="View from my office, Sydney" src="/images/sydney_work.jpg" title="View from my office" /></p>

<p>I moved over to Sydney last year around the same time. It was difficult to adjust in during the initial days, but soon it all started to fall into the rhythm. It&rsquo;s been a year with Readify and at my client and I am enjoying the new experiences.</p>
