    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;<em>Oh yes! That is an expected error. It is because…</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>How many times have you given that explanation yourself or heard the other developer tell that? Known errors or exceptions are common in applications and us developers find ways to live with such errors. At times when the number of such errors grows it becomes a problem directly or indirectly to the business. These known errors could either be exceptions in application logs, failed messages (commands/events) in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture">message based architecture</a>, alert popups in Windows client applications, etc.</p>

<p><img alt="Known Errors" src="/images/known_errors.png" /></p>

<p>We should try and keep known errors and exception count close to zero. Below are some of the problems that can happen by ignoring it over a period.</p>

<h4><strong>Business Value</strong></h4>

<p>Since the errors are known to us, we train ourselves or even the users to ignore them. It is easy to justify that fixing them does not have any business value as there is no direct impact. This assumption need not be true. If a piece of code has no value then why is it there in the first place? Possibly it is not having any visible effects at present but might be having an impact at a later point in time. It could also be that it is not affecting the data consistency of your system, but is a problem for an external system. There can be business flows that are written at a later point of time not being aware of this known error. Some developer time gets lost when glancing over such errors or messages in the log which directly equates to money for the business.</p>

<h4><strong>Important Errors Missed</strong></h4>

<p>If there are a lot of such known errors, it is easy for new or important ones to get missed or ignored. Depending on the frequency of the known error, it can end up flooding the logs. The logs start to get overwhelming to monitor or trace for other issues with lots of such known errors. The natural tendency for people when they find something overwhelming is to ignore it. I worked on a system which had over 250 failed messages coming to the error queue daily. It was overwhelming to monitor them and was soon getting ignored. Important errors were getting missed and often ended up as support requests for the application. Such errors otherwise could have been proactively handled, giving the end user more confidence.</p>

<h4><strong>Lower Perceived Stability</strong></h4>

<p>The overall perceived stability of the system comes down as more and more such errors happen. It is applicable both for the users and developers. When errors no longer get monitored or tracked, critical errors gets ignored. Users have to resort to other means like support requests for the errors they face. For users who are new to the system, it might take a while to get used to the known errors. These errors decrease the trust they have in the system and soon starts suspecting everything as an issue or a problem.</p>

<p>Seeing more and more of such errors does not leave a positive impact on the developers. It&rsquo;s possible that developers loose interest to work on an unstable system and start looking for a change. It is also a challenge when new members join the team. It takes time for them to get used to errors and exceptions and to learn to ignore them.</p>

<h4><strong>Stereotyping Exceptions</strong></h4>

<p>Errors of a particular type can get stereotyped together, and get ignored mistaking it for one that is already known. It is easy for different &lsquo;<em>object null reference exception</em>&rsquo; error messages to be treated as a particular error whereas it could be failing for various reasons. At one of my clients, we had a specific message type failing with the null reference error. We had identified the reason for one such message and found that it is not causing &lsquo;<em>any direct business impact</em>&rsquo; and can be ignored. The message was failing as one of the properties on the message was alphanumeric while the code expected numeric. The simple fix in the code would be to validate it, but since this was not causing any business impact it was ignored, and messages of that type kept piling up. Until later where we found that there were other message formats of the same message type failing which was for a different reason. And those messages were causing a loss of revenue to the business. But since we were stereotyping the error messages of the particular type to the one that we found invalid and not having a business impact all of such messages were ignored. The stereotyping resulted in the important message getting ignored.</p>

<h4><strong>Maintaining a Known Bugs Database</strong></h4>

<p>When having a large number of such errors, it is important to document a list of such errors.It forces us to a new document and also comes with the responsibility of maintaining it. For any new developers or users joining the system, they need to go through the documentation to verify if it is a known error or not. Internalizing these errors might take some time, and critical errors can get missed during this time. Any such document needs to be kept current and up to date as and when new errors are found or more details found for older ones. This is not the best of places where a developers time is spent.</p>

<h4><strong>Count Keeps Increasing</strong></h4>

<p>If the count of such errors is not monitored and not valued for the probability of the number of error messages increasing is higher. New errors getting introduced will not be noticed, and even when noticed it becomes acceptable. <em>We already have a lot of them, so it is fine.</em> It sets a wrong goal for the team and can soon become unmanageable.</p>

<h4><strong>New Business Flow Assuming Exception</strong>s</h4>

<p>Since the exceptions are so used to, it is highly possible that we set that as an expectation. New business flows come up expecting a certain kind of exception to be thrown or assuming a particular type of message will not get processed. Since we are so used to the fact that it happens, we take it for granted and start coding against it. It might be the last thing that happens on a project, but believe me, it happens!. Such code becomes harder to maintain and might not work once the actual exception gets fixed.</p>

<p>Ignoring exceptions and getting around to live with it can be more costly over a longer period. The further we delay action on such errors the higher the cost involved. Even though there is no immediate or direct business value seen from fixing such errors, we saw that on a longer run it could have a great impact. So try not to live with such errors but instead prioritize them with the work your team is doing and get it fixed. A fix might not always be an extra null check or a conditional to avoid the error. It might seem the easier approach to reducing the errors but will soon become a different problem. Understand the business and explore into what is causing the error. Do you have any known exceptions in the application you are working? What are you doing about it?</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/psm-learnings/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/psm-learnings</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month I attended the Professional Scrum Master (PSM) training. <a href="https://twitter.com/rbanks54">Richard Banks</a> was the training instructor who also happens to be my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">colleague at Readify</a>. It is a two days training and was a great experience for me. It changed my perception towards Scrum. Before the training, I was not that fascinated about Scrum and often argued against it citing that it&rsquo;s development practices that we need to uphold more and not Scrum. After the training, I have still not changed on the latter part but have changed my perception towards Scrum. Here are some of the key takeaways for me from the training.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Stick to the Process</li>
<li>Make Daily Scrum (a.k.a Standup) effective by setting mini goals</li>
<li>Understand the different Roles and imbibe the responsibilities</li>
<li>Have a well-defined Definition for Done</li>
<li>Deliver value in every sprint</li>
<li>Foster team collaboration and openness</li>
<li>Scrum is not the Silver Bullet. Other development practices must be followed in parallel.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are completely new to Scrum or not so familiar with the different terms used I recommend that you read <a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">The Scrum Guide</a>. Don&rsquo;t refrain from clicking that link thinking it is a long book. It is a short one, and you can finish it in less than an hour. It is an hour well spent!</p>

<p><img alt="Scrum Framework" src="/images/scrum_framework.png" /></p>

<h3>Sticking to the Process</h3>

<p>Everyone who was attending the training was already using Scrum, <em>but..</em> This is one of the common things with mostly everything and specifically with Scrum. People take parts of it and change the system to suit their needs. This is fine as long as you have tried the original process long enough to understand the pros and cons of it.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Tweaking the process to suit existing practices as soon as you start with a new process is just <strong>resistance to change</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Like Uncle Bob Martin says in clean code, dedicate yourself to the process and follow it religiously until you have mastered the process. You can start modifying the process or finding new ways once you have reached that state. But till then follow it religiously if you want to see any benefit.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Martial artists do not all agree about the best martial art, or the best technique within a martial art. Often master martial artists will form their own schools of thought and gather students to learn from them. So we see Gracie Jiu Jistu, founded and taught by the Gracie family in Brazil. We see Hakkoryu Jiu Jistu, founded and taught by Okuyama Ryuho in Tokyo. We see Jeet Kune Do, founded and taught by Bruce Lee in the United States.</em></p>

<p><em>Students of these approaches immerse themselves in the teachings of the founder.They dedicate themselves to learn what that particular master teaches, often to the exclusion of any other master’s teaching. Later, as the students grow in their art, they may become the student of a different master so they can broaden their knowledge and practice. Some eventually go on to refine their skills, discovering new techniques and founding their own schools. None of these different schools is absolutely right. Yet within a particular school we act as though the teachings and techniques are right. After all, there is a right way to practice Hakkoryu Jiu Jitsu, or Jeet Kune Do. But this rightness within a school does not invalidate the teachings of a different school.</em></p>

<p><em>-Uncle Bob Martin, <a href="http://amzn.to/2kCHgVz">Clean Code</a></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Effectiveness of Daily Scrum</h3>

<p>Daily Scrum or otherwise popular as Standup meetings are <strong>not about standing up to give status updates</strong>. The intent of the Daily Scrum is for the development team to get together and work out whatever is required to get closer to the goal set for the sprint. Standing up improves your activity levels and interaction levels. So it&rsquo;s recommended to stand up. The primary intent of the fifteen minutes time-boxed event (it can take no more than the allotted time) is to look at how we tracked on with our &lsquo;mini goals&rsquo; from last daily scrum and setting new &lsquo;mini goals&rsquo; till next stand up. Also, capture any impediments or blockers and make sure that there are assigned people following up on it. The daily scrum necessarily needs not be the first thing in the morning but is usually preferred. Currently, I am on an evening 4 pm daily scrum.</p>

<h3>Roles and Their Importance</h3>

<p>Understanding of the different roles in Scrum is necessary. A scrum team consists of</p>

<ul>
<li>The Product Owner</li>
<li>Scrum Master</li>
<li>Development team</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><em>Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Most important is to understand the responsibilities of each role and adhere to it as much as possible. Remember Sticking to the Process is important. Each of the roles must have the courage and openness to act according to their role responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Definition of Done</h3>

<p>Having a prior agreed on Definition of Done is important to decide when a piece of work is done. Having a common understanding of the definition of done ensures that we do not ship half-baked features. It also provides a guide for non-functional features, which often gets sidelined or missed and later becomes a show-stopper.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of “Done” will expand to include more stringent criteria for higher quality. Any one product or system should have a definition of “Done” that is a standard for any work done on it.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Delivering Value</h3>

<p>One of the golden rules is that every sprint must produce an increment that adds some business value. It need not be released to production, but it must be production ready. The Product Owner makes release decisions.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This hints that having sprints solely for handling Technical debts, Refactoring, Project setup, Infrastructure setup, etc. are not recommended.</p>

<h3>Team collaboration and Effectiveness</h3>

<p>The process heavily depends on the people encompassing The Scrum Team. So it is important to have a good rapport amongst the team members. The team members should be comfortable and open with each other. The team needs to be self-organizing. When starting with Scrum, this might not be the case, and the team must recognize this and work towards self-organizing. The Scrum Master must encourage and guide the team to reach that state of independence.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>When the values of commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of <strong>transparency, inspection, and adaptation</strong> come to life and build trust for everyone.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><img alt="Scrum Values" src="/images/scrum_values.png" /></p>

<p>The Scrum Guide calls out the above five core values that a team should demonstrate for the effectiveness of the framework. The Scrum team should constantly try to demonstrate these core values and try to improve on this.</p>

<h3>Not the Silver Bullet for Development</h3>

<blockquote><p><em>There&rsquo;s a mess I&rsquo;ve heard about with quite a few projects recently. It works out like this:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>They want to use an agile process, and pick Scrum</em></li>
<li><em>They adopt the Scrum practices, and maybe even the principles</em></li>
<li><em>After a while progress is slow because the code base is a mess</em></li>
</ul>


<p> <em>-Martin Fowler, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html">Flaccid Scrum</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>If you are looking up to Scrum to solve the problems with the quality of code you are delivering, you are with the wrong process. Scrum does not talk anything specific about software development and related practices. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">Extreme Programming</a> is one process that is specific to coding and software development and is also a type of agile software development. It talks about the various development practices lays down strict rules <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">related to software development</a>. Again if you decide to follow this do that religiously - Sticking to the Process matters. Picking up only certain aspects of different school of thoughts might not provide the desired output always. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/is-code-coverage-a-lie/">Code Coverage</a> if one such practice that is picked up in isolation and seen to produce not much value.</p>

<p>Given these new insights, I now feel that following a proven process framework, like Scrum will help a team achieve its goals. The core values that Scrum lays down is important for any team. From my personal experience, the reason why I used to look down upon Scrum is that it was not practiced the way it was laid out. Like in software development premature optimization of the process is likely to give less value. The training provided a lot of new insights and helped me to have a better understanding of the Scrum process framework. I did the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-certifications/professional-scrum-master-i-assessment">PSM I</a> and <a href="https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-certifications/professional-scrum-product-owner-i-assessment">PSPO I</a> (I had attended this training last year but never took the test until now) assessment and got certified.  Are you using Scrum, what are your experiences?</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/recording-my-first-screencast/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/recording-my-first-screencast</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Screencast helps to connect with people in a different way and adds a personal touch (sound and visual). It makes learning new things faster, by seeing it in action. Most of the fine details (which can be missed while writing a blog post) get captured in screencasting and this helps in better understanding. I have been long wanting to create screencasts and start a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RahulNath">YouTube channel</a>. Finally, this <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/2016-recap/">happened in 2016</a> and here is how the recording experience went.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast">screencast</a> is a digital recording of computer screen output, also known as a video screen capture, often containing audio narration.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Presentation</h3>

<p>I chose to do my first screencast as a slide share presentation, as it was something that I was comfortable with. Since there are not many videos on <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/azure-key-vault/">Azure Key Vault</a> and I have been blogging extensively about it, I didn&rsquo;t have to think twice about the topic. I scripted the whole presentation, to every word that I would say. Scripting for a video is different from writing a blog post as it has to be conversational with a video. Also, there are a lot more details that need to be covered and talked about as it is all visible on the recording.</p>

<p>Since I did not have an external monitor I wanted a presentation application that allows presenter notes and syncs them across multiple devices. This would allow me to record the screen and read off the presenter notes side by side. <a href="http://slides.com/">Slides</a> had exactly what I wanted. It allows to add presenter notes for each slide and allows <a href="http://help.slides.com/knowledgebase/articles/333925-remote-control">remote controlling</a> the presentation from multiple devices. So I can launch it as a full-screen presentation on my laptop for recording screen and have an iPad or mobile launch the same presentation as a presenter where the notes show up. This helped me follow the script while recording the video. It would have been much easier with multiple monitors, but I just did not want to get one just for this and I have been trying to get used with a single screen. Alternatively, I could have taken a printout of the script.</p>

<p><img alt="Using slides on multiple devices" src="/images/screencast_slides_multidevice.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Microphone</h3>

<p>An external microphone is absolutely necessary to record your sound well. The microphone that comes built into the laptop is not suited for recording good quality audio. It picks a lot more of the background noises, room noise, typing etc and creates a lot of disturbance in the recording. There are a lot of options available when it comes to getting an external microphone. Most of the microphones are either <a href="http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/best-condenser-mics/">Condenser Mics</a> or <a href="http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/dynamic-studio-microphone/">Dynamic Mics</a>. Microphones also have different connectivity options like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLR_connector">XLR</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB">USB</a> etc. For a home recording setup USB is easier to get started with so I decided to get one with a <a href="http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/usb-microphones/">USB connectivity</a>.</p>

<p>I got the <a href="http://www.rode.com/microphones/podcaster">Rode Podcaster</a> with a <a href="http://www.rode.com/accessories/psa1">boom arm</a> and <a href="http://www.rode.com/accessories/psm1">shock mount</a>. The Rode Podcaster is a dynamic USB mic and is a popular choice amongst many people out there. It&rsquo;s a bit higher on the price side (depends on your budget though) but delivers great value. It cuts off most of the room noise and takes in only your voice which is exactly what I wanted. You need to get really close into the mic, so a boom arm helps.</p>

<p><img alt="Screencast Microphone, Rode Podcaster" src="/images/screencast_microphone_rode.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>Choosing the software was much easier than getting the microphone. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/au/products/premiere.html?sdid=VBF1KRFN&amp;mv=search&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!107609177344!e!!g!!adobe%20premiere&amp;ef_id=Ve-MSAAABFDV-qvS:20170101175215:s">Adobe Premiere</a> or <a href="http://shop.techsmith.com/store/techsm/en_AU/pd/productID.289432000">Camtasia</a> are the most popular screen recording software&rsquo;s in the windows world. I have a lot of friends already using Camtasia and was happy with it. So I decided to stick with Camtasia and bought a license (Thanks to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">Readify&rsquo;s</a> Software Allowance, I did not have to spend a lot from my pocket).</p>

<p>For recording audio, I use <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, which is an open source software and available free of cost. I am yet to learn some audio processing techniques and for now just use noise removal, amplify and compression. Also since the Rode microphone does not pick a lot of external noise the audio did not require much processing. At first, I tried recording with a <a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/gomic/">Samson GO mic</a> but felt that it picked it a lot more room noise and it needed a lot more audio processing.</p>

<h3>Recording</h3>

<p>With the hardware and software sorted now comes the hardest part of it all - Recording!!. I knew there would be difficulties along the way, but never thought it would be this hard. After reading around I understood that a popular technique that people use for recording is to record the audio and video separately for webcasts/screen recordings. I decide to take the same approach but just that did it in the wrong order (which I found after the first recording). For my first video I did the video first and the audio later. This meant that I recorded my screen performing all the slide movements and the code sample demo and then tried to fit the audio onto it. This was the biggest mistake in my complete recording, but I realized it only towards the end of the recording. Recording video was easy but fitting in the sound to it was hard. I had to do multiple (innumerous) takes and have to stop so often every now and then. And since I am yet to learn <em>how to talk naturally when in front of a microphone</em>, my voice was all over the place. Some bits had more bass, some a bit low others high, some fast others slow. I struggled with it for a long time and finally somehow got to get it all together. But though it was nowhere close to the quality that I set out for or would love to have in videos that I watch, I decided to ship it. For the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbshGF4ZwGE">second recording</a>, I recorded the audio first and then fitted in the video onto it. This was so much easier and I have a more consistent voice in that, though there is a noticeable change in the middle.</p>

<p>I am planning to do more recordings in the upcoming months so that I get more comfortable with it. <strong><em>If it hurts, do it more often</em></strong>. Kindly leave your feedback on the videos.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Making Code Reviews Effective]]></title>
    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/code-review/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/code-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Code review is an essential practice of the development life cycle. It helps improve the code quality, unify team practices, share knowledge, mentoring etc. over a longer period of time. It helps find mistakes that are overlooked while developing and helps improve the overall quality of the software. This helps accelerate the deployment process as changes are more likely to pass through testing.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Peer review—an activity in which people other than the author of a software deliverable examine it for defects and improvement opportunities—is one of the most powerful software quality tools available. Peer review methods include inspections, walkthroughs, peer desk checks, and other similar activities.</em></p>

<p>-<a href="http://www.processimpact.com/articles/humanizing_reviews.html"><strong> Karl E. Wiegers</strong></a></p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" alt="Posts per month - 2016" src="/images/codereview_friendly.png"/></p>

<p>Below are some of my thoughts on the various aspects involved in a Code Review.</p>

<h3>Sending a Review</h3>

<p>Before sending for a code review make sure that only the necessary files for the change are added in the review. Often it happens that when we write code there are remains of things that we tried and discarded, like new files, packages, changes to project metadata files etc. Double check and make sure that the changes are what are just required. Ensure that the code builds successfully. If there are any build scripts that your team uses, make sure that those are run and passes successfully. When submitting a code review make sure that you reference the associated work item - be it a bug, story, task etc. Add <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/testing/">tests</a>. Add in a description detailing the change and any reasoning behind it to add in more context. This will help the reviewer understand the code much faster. Add in relevant people for the review and submit a request. Check out <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/01/15/10-tips-for-better-pull-requests/">some great tips for a better-looking review request</a>.</p>

<h3>Handling Review Comments</h3>

<p>One of the key things in a code review and one that&rsquo;s often missed and drives people frustrated is that they try to take it all in.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Not all comments in a review needs to be addressed</em></p></blockquote>

<p>If a review comment points out a mistake in logic or business functionality or conflict with other code you need to fix them, unless you think the reviewer is wrong. But for suggestions on how better to structure your code or refactor into a more readable code, naming, style formatting etc needs addressing only if you feel they are adding value. But make sure to communicate well with the reviewer and reach an agreement.</p>

<p>Look at comments as a way to improve your code and help the team and business. Go in with a positive attitude. When seen as an overhead or an extra ritual, code reviews can be really painful and depressing. Make a note of commonly occurring comments or mistakes you are making and try to handle them at the time of development. Rather than mechanically going through the code review and making changes to the code, internalize on the change and try to see the benefits of a change. This helps to incorporate such suggestions in future reviews as well.</p>

<h3>Responding to a Code Review</h3>

<p>I usually find myself following the below three variations when coming to replying to a code review request</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comment and Wait</strong>
I leave comments on the review but do not approve. This means that I would like to have those comments actioned and a new pull request be raised for that. This often falls into those cases where there are logic or business issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comment and Approve</strong>
I leave comments (if any) but also approve the code review. This means that the code <em>Looks Good To Me</em> (LGTM), but would be better with the comments addressed. These comments generally relate to better formatting, improved on naming or refactoring readability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add Relevant People</strong>
Add in reviewers that I feel are missed and relevant for the part of the code that is changed.  This I do irrespective of the above two options if I feel someone else needs to take a look. In these cases, if it was my review that gets added in an extra reviewer I would wait to get a sign off from that person too.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4><strong>Business Aspect</strong></h4>

<p>When reviewing code look first for the functionality that the code change addresses. It is possible that we get carried away just by the technical aspect of code and ignore the business aspect altogether. If you have <a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/2014/09/acceptance-criteria/">Acceptance Criteria</a> defined for tasks then it&rsquo;s worth reading it before doing the code review to get more context.</p>

<h4><strong>Technical aspect</strong></h4>

<p>Once the business aspect is covered have a look at the technical aspect of the change. Whether the code is decoupled, has the correct abstractions, follows team conventions (best if automated). Check for commonly occurring problems like improper usage of dispose pattern, magic numbers, large methods, all code flow paths not handled etc. See if the new code fits into the overall architecture of the application. Look for tests and ensure the validity of the test data. Look out for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overengineering">overengineering</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">not invented here syndrome</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Aesthetic</strong></h4>

<p>Code formatting is as important as the code itself. Code is read more often than written, so we should try and optimize code for reading. I would prefer to automate this as far as possible so that people don&rsquo;t need to look for these in reviews. I feel that is often time not well spent and also tends to lead to longer discussions (<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/death-to-the-space-infidels/">tabs vs Spaces</a>). When it is part of the build and automated people seldom complain about it and in a very short period of time, the formatting rules become second nature to them. If you currently do not have automated checks you can gradually <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/introducing-code-formatting-into-a-large-codebase/">introduce formatting checks into your builds for a large code base</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Don&rsquo;t go by &lsquo;It&rsquo;s done like that everywhere so I will keep it the same&rsquo;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>There might be a lot of practices that is being followed over the period of time. But if you find any of the practices making it harder on a day-to-day functioning of the team, take a step towards changing the practice. I am not a fan of &lsquo;<em>clean it all at once</em>&rsquo; style of approach. I prefer to gradually introduce the change for two reasons</p>

<ul>
<li>No need to stop or allocate people to repeatedly do the same task of cleaning it everywhere. (Unless there is a very strong business justification to it)</li>
<li>You get gradually introduced to the new way of doing things. This gives time to reflect and compare with the old way. You have time to correct yourself if the new approach is not fitting well either or causing more trouble than previous.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Handling Conflicts</h3>

<p><img class="center" alt="Posts per month - 2016" src="/images/codereview_wtf.png"/></p>

<p>Foster environments where you don&rsquo;t curb discussions or other people&rsquo;s ideas but encourage everyone to actively participate and throw around even the stupidest of an idea.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Psychological safety is a “shared belief, held by members of a team, that the group is a safe place for taking risks.” It is “a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up,” Edmondson wrote in a 1999 paper. “It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-build-perfect-team-charles-duhigg"><strong>- Charles Duhigg</strong>, <em>What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team</em></a></p></blockquote>

<p>Code reviews should also be seen as a way to incorporate better practices from fellow developers and as a learning mechanism. Don&rsquo;t take comments personal, but look at it for what they are. When you have a conflicting opinion you can reply to the comment with your thoughts and cross check with the reviewer. Rarely it can happen that you have conflicting opinions on code review comments and you are not able to solve it among the people involved.  Walk up to the person (if you are co-located) or have a conversation over your teams messaging application. But make sure that it stays healthy. In case the discussion is not going the intended way you can involve senior team members or other fellow team members to seek their opinions too. If such kinds of conflicts are happening more often then the team needs to analyze the nature of review comments that these occur on, if it&rsquo;s between specific groups of people or any visible patterns and try to address them.</p>

<p>When taken in isolation any practices that a team does take time. So disregard any activity just because it adds more time to your process. When seen as part of the overall development cycle and the benefits it brings to the business, Code Reviews proves to be an essential practice. Different teams tend to have different guidelines and checklists for the reviews. Follow what works best for your team. Do you do code reviews as part of your development cycle? What do you feel important in a Code Review? Sound off in the comments!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past couple of years, I have read a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-help_book">Self-help books</a>. Here are a few that I liked and have drawn ideas from. Self-help books in itself is an easy way to procrastinate as you get an immediate high on knowing how optimized and productive your life can be. I have fallen for this a lot of times and its hard to keep away from it. Every time I read one of these books, I get the feeling that this is going to change my life. But then when I get to the end of the book all I need is more of it and ends up <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/why-self-help-books-rarel_b_9517224.html">starting with a new book</a>. Slowly with time I started to realize that all that is happening is reading and very little action.</p>

<p>To be successful with any of these books you need to draw ideas into your daily life and practice them. You need to build short term goals and get the behavior you are trying to create into you.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Reading without action is just another way to procrastinate and is a waste of time.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Take notes from the books, see how it can be incorporated into your daily life and improve one at a time. Revisit the notes often. I prefer reading this genre of books on the Kindle (<a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/ebook-or-hard-copy/">technical books I prefer physical copy</a>), as it requires little flipping back and forth.  On Kindle, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201241990">add or remove bookmarks, highlights, and notes at any location</a> and revisit this at a later point in time.</p>
