<em>And The beginning of a bad habit is the finding of an excuse</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The ability to pick on something and to make a habit of it is something that is always helpful. This skill helps to create new habits and also let go off old ones that are not doing any good to you. Part of letting of bad old habits might be creating new ones. When I wrote about <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/three_months_to_a_half_marathon/">Couch to Half Marathon</a>, some of my readers asked how to keep up with the plan. How to do &lsquo;Couch to Street&rsquo;; just getting out there.</p>

</a></p>

<h3>How Habits Work</h3>

<p>To form new habits, it is important that we understand <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/">how habits work</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>a simple neurological loop at the core of every habit, a loop that consists of three parts: <strong>A cue, a routine and a reward.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>As Charles Duhigg points out in his book, Power Of Habits (<a href="http://amzn.to/2gOYluc">recommended read</a>) the formula for changing habits differs from habit and persons. So it is more about using a framework to understand how habits work and experimenting on changing it. Changing a habit does take time and is not an easy one, but with a process in place, it is doable with time and effort.</p>

<p><img src="/images/habit_loop.jpg" class="center" alt="Cue-Routine-Reward Habit Loop" /></p>

<p>To break a bad habit one needs to identify it first. It could be anything from spending too much time on social media, eating unhealthy food, smoking, drinking, etc. Identifying that you have a habit and it&rsquo;s not good for you to continue with it is important. You can only change something once you identify it.</p>

<p>Once you recognize the habit, find out what is the trigger for the habit. Is it a particular place, people, time, etc. It might be hard to find the specific cue that triggers the habit, so note down everything that you find applicable. Then work on to isolate the cue by monitoring the habit over a couple of days. Wire up the cue that triggers the habit to perform some other action. Create that plan in advance and have some way to remind yourself of it. If your cue is time-based or location based, then you can use your smartphone to pop-up a reminder. If not try to find ways to keep yourself reminded to perform the new plan. It feels hard in the beginning but stick to the plan, and in time you will be able to change your habit. I recommend you to read the book <a href="http://amzn.to/2gOYluc">Power of Habits</a> to understand this subject better.</p>

<h3>Mini Habits and Short Term Goals</h3>

<p>To start creating new habits, I have found setting smaller goals to target daily works better. I began writing at least one line every day to be <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/maintaining-a-blogging-schedule/">consistent in blogging</a>, running at least once a week to establish an exercise routine, eat at least one meal healthy, etc. Time-based cues help to enforce such new behavior. Setting aside a specific time as per the desired frequency to perform the activity makes sure that you do not skip doing it. Also, remember to keep the action as simple as possible so that you do not procrastinate when the time comes.</p>

<p>Like if it is running that you are planning to start it could be -  <em>Every Saturday at 6 am I will wear my running shoes and get out of my house</em>. When the time comes, this is such a simple task that you have set for yourself, and you are more likely to do it. Once you have taken the pain of putting the shoes and getting out of the couch, you are more likely to run for at least five minutes.</p>

<p>Break your goals into small and achievable mini goals. These mini goals are often referred to as <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Most Important Tasks (MIT)</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/experimenting-with-pomodoro-technique/">Big Rocks</a> etc. The key is to break them down into smaller achievable mini-goals and setting a cue to trigger the activity.</p>

<h3>Motivation and Its Role</h3>

<p>Very often we get motivated to start new activities and begin with great enthusiasm. In the beginning, we feel a spike in energy and see things happening. But soon you hit a point where you feel nothing is moving and you feel it a burden to continue. This stage is referred to as <em>plateau - a state of little or no change following a period of activity or progress.</em> You soon see your motivation levels dropping and justifying to yourself how little or no benefit your actions have. Eventually, you find yourself losing entire interest in the activity and start looking for new motivation spikes. This has happened to me many times.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Motivation is what gets you started.Habit is what keeps you going.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I have found this to be entirely true. We need the motivation to help us to get started with new activities and set new goals. But motivation alone cannot help us go all the way and achieve what we want. Before jump-starting with the idea give it a good thought to check if it is worth your time spent. If not park the idea to your <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/2010/10/what-goes-on-a-someday-maybe-list/">Someday Maybe list</a> (as referred to in <a href="http://amzn.to/2gsJaed">GTD</a>).</p>

<p>Once you have decided to pursue the idea, break it into smaller pieces and set achievable &lsquo;mini goals.&rsquo; Set dedicated time at regular intervals for achieving these mini-goals. Most important is in having some &lsquo;me time&rsquo; to get towards these goals. Like for me I have found that <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/waking-up-early-is-all-about-waking-up-to-an-alarm/">mornings work best for me</a> and created a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Morning Routine</a>. To make sure that I make the best of my time I try to work in <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/experimenting-with-pomodoro-technique/">Pomodoro&rsquo;s and inspect and adapt the process</a> often.</p>

<h3>Tracking and Feedback</h3>

<p>Tracking is an important part of habit formation. Once you have set your goals and mini habits also find ways to track your progress. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/psm-learnings/">Inspect and Adapt</a> is the fundamental principle behind Agile Processes. Habit formation is nothing but being agile, keeping the end goal in mind, adjusting the way you reach there. Find ways and tools to track progress on the habits that you are trying to form.</p>

<p>I prefer automatic tracking with least manual entry, so the tracking happens in the background. But at times you will have to resort to manual methods as well. Make sure you have a time set aside daily to capture the information. Having a review of the data obtained once every week or two and taking adjustment actions is equally important. Some of the tracking tools that I use are <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/rescue-time-track-your-time/">Rescue Time</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/three_months_to_a_half_marathon/">Garmin Forerunner 630</a> and a few manual ones. I [review my progress every week] and try to incorporate feedback into the upcoming week.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>All it takes to start a new habit is a moment - The moment where you decide on the new habit. The rest is process!</em></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/">Eating Healthy, Exercise</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/maintaining-a-blogging-schedule/">Blogging</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/waking-up-early-is-all-about-waking-up-to-an-alarm/">Waking up Early</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/experimenting-with-pomodoro-technique/">Reducing time spent on Social Media, Reading</a> and <strike><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/recording-my-first-screencast/">Creating Videos</a></strike> (looking to give this up) are some of the habits that I have formed following these techniques. The ability to decide on something and getting it to done is the most important of all. Once you have mastered the skill of forming new habits, it boils down to choosing good habits and wiring that into your life. I have heard about the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonselk/2013/04/15/habit-formation-the-21-day-myth/">21-Day rule of habit formation</a> and similar myths. But I think all it takes to start a new habit is a moment - The moment where you decide on the new habit. The rest is process!</p>

    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/three_months_to_a_half_marathon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s about three months since I started running. I just completed my first half marathon and thought of putting together on how I have been going on with my running. I had a lot of questions myself when I started running, so hope this helps someone else taking the same journey.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>DISCLAIMER!</strong> Just to make sure I get it right, I am not a doctor nor a professional runner. The below are just my personal experiences and has worked for me. If you feel you have a medical problem or are in need of professional help, please contact a professional. Always consult a doctor before starting a new diet or exercise program.
</div>


<h3>Tracking</h3>

<p>I started running using the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runtastic.android&amp;hl=en">Runtastic</a> application on my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/">android phone</a>. The free version app offers most of the required features to start running. I upgraded to their <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/premium-membership">Premium version</a> primarily for <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/results">Runtastic Results</a>(more on it below).</p>

<p>Once I got regular with my runs I wanted better tracking, mainly to monitor heart rate. I was unsure of what a heart rate monitor would provide and if at all there is any value in getting one. I reached out to my runner friends, and all of them had one. Most of them had a Garmin, and a few had Fitbit. Until then I was planning to get the <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/au/charge2">Fitbit Charge 2</a> which comes with <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/whats-inside-fitness-tracker-anyway/#ixzz4cBARwI9q">optical heart rate monitoring</a>. It primarily uses an optical sensor and senses the heart rate from the wrist. The Garmin&rsquo;s make watches that are more <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-AU/AU/cIntoSports-cRunning-p1.html">specific for runners</a>, and since the majority of my friends owned Garmin, I decided on to get one of the Garmin Forerunner series.</p>

<p>One of the shops near to where I live was running a promotional offer on the <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-AU/AU/p/516105">Garmin Forerunner 630 Bundle</a>. But this model comes with a <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-AU/AU/p/530376">Heart Rate Monitor (HRM) Strap</a>. The strap needs to be worn around the chest during the run. Strap v Optical HRM added a new dimension of confusion to the whole tracker story. I reached out to my <a href="https://twitter.com/rahulpnath/status/835320810734694400">runner friends again</a> and surprisingly all of them had models of Garmin that uses an HRM Strap.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wareable.com/garmin/garmin-forerunner-630-review">
<img alt="Garmin Forerunner 630 Bundle" class="center" src="/images/running_forerunner630.jpg" />
</a></p>

<p>The Garmin Forerunner 630 is a GPS SmartWatch with Advanced Running Metrics. It provides all the data a runner needs (and a lot more than what I need). Paired with HRM monitor it helps measure cadence, vertical oscillation and additional running dynamics like ground contact time balance, stride length and vertical ratio. I still don&rsquo;t understand all the data that it shows but find the GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring and zones, training plans and custom workouts a great help to my runs. Garmin also integrates well with <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/rahulpnath">Strava</a> where most of my other friends are there. The watch has a companion app on the phone and also a <a href="http://connect.garmin.com">website</a> which helps visualize the data.</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/results">Runtastic Results</a> provides a 12-week bodyweight training plan with the <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/premium-membership">premium subscription</a>. I am on week five of the training. It took a while for me to get started but now I try not to miss it. The free version of the app has all exercises available as stand-alone exercises. You can use these if you don&rsquo;t want to get the premium subscription.</p>

<p><img alt="Runtastic Results" class="center" src="/images/running_runtastic_results.png" /></p>

<p>I am following a diet to lose weight, and I weigh now 78 (±1) kilos and has been on that for around one month. I was around 95 when I started out with the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/">running and diet</a>.</p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>During the first few weeks of running, I was mostly doing free runs and trying to cover the maximum distance possible. The tracked information was useful in isolation to a specific run, and I did not do anything to improve. I then started on a beginner training plan with Runtastic
to <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/users/4b76cfab-734e-1658-b5e4-600759a3b066/training-plans/747577">Run 50 min after 6 weeks</a>. This put me into the mode to compare my runs with the previous and work to improve on them. Now and then I wanted to stop the plan and continue with my normal run as I felt the plan wasn&rsquo;t working. But I decided to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/psm-learnings/">stick to the process</a> until the end. On completion of the training, I was able to run continuously for fifty minutes, and that was a measurable improvement for me.</p>

<p><img alt="Runtastic Training Plan Certificate" src="/images/running_runtastic_certificate.png" /></p>

<p>My friend and colleague <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/12340841">Tony</a> is an avid runner. To improve on the pace, he advised starting shorter interval training. To improve pace, fix the pace to what you want to achieve and run for a specified interval (time or distance). Garmin enables you to create a custom workout setting various parameters on the run. The custom workout helps to keep up with your goals during the run.</p>

<p><img alt="Garmin Custom Workout" class="center" src="/images/running_garmin_workout.jpg" /></p>

<p>Running at a constant pace is important to help cover longer distances. Initially, I used to run with all my energy. So my pace often spiked and then fell and then spiked again. If you are training to improve your speed, it&rsquo;s hard to tell whether there is an improvement in speed unless you run at a constant (little variation) in speed. Check out the graph that plots your pace to check the pace variations. Most running applications show this information.</p>

<h3>Breathing</h3>

<p>Proper breathing is one the key things with running. I did not give much importance to breathing at first. I found it very hard to run long distances without stopping in between by following a random breathing pattern. There are different suggestions on breathing style. I found the article <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/running-on-air-breathing-technique">Running On Air: Breathing Technique</a> helpful and try to follow the pattern mentioned there (quoted below).</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The singular point of all rhythmic breathing patterns is this: Exhale on alternate footstrikes as you run. You never want to continually exhale on the same foot. The rhythmic breathing patterns I recommend call for a longer inhale than exhale. Why the longer inhale? Your diaphragm and other breathing muscles contract during inhalation, which brings stability to your core. These same muscles relax during exhalation, decreasing stability. With the goal of injury prevention in mind, it&rsquo;s best to hit the ground more often when your body is at its most stable—during inhalation. Let&rsquo;s start with a 5-count or 3:2 pattern of rhythmic breathing, which will apply to most of your running. Inhale for three steps and exhale for two.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I particularly liked the reference to yoga and meditation in the article. It gave the realization that running is a form of meditation. Establishing a breathing rhythm helped me run longer distances comfortably and without losing breath. If you want to get a deeper understanding of breath and how it affects our life I recommend reading the book <a href="http://amzn.to/2nkIlUQ">Science Of Breath</a>.</p>

<p>I ran my first <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/users/4b76cfab-734e-1658-b5e4-600759a3b066/sport-sessions/58d587fdd03a4c443e6d656c">Half Marathon</a> on 25th of March. I did at a casual pace to understand what it takes to run one. I tried to keep my pace between 6:15 - 6:30 min/km and was able to finish it at 6:19 min/km. It took me 2:13:11 hours and I am glad that I did not stop even once. It was more a mental game to stay at it than anything physical, and I am happy that I could finish it successfully! Hope this helps someone else as well starting off with running. Sound off in the comments if this helps you or some tips if you are already a runner!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/the-problems-with-known-exception-and-ignoring-it/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/the-problems-with-known-exception-and-ignoring-it</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;<em>Oh yes! That is an expected error. It is because…</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>How many times have you given that explanation yourself or heard the other developer tell that? Known errors or exceptions are common in applications and us developers find ways to live with such errors. At times when the number of such errors grows it becomes a problem directly or indirectly to the business. These known errors could either be exceptions in application logs, failed messages (commands/events) in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture">message based architecture</a>, alert popups in Windows client applications, etc.</p>

<p><img alt="Known Errors" src="/images/known_errors.png" /></p>

<p>We should try and keep known errors and exception count close to zero. Below are some of the problems that can happen by ignoring it over a period.</p>

<h4><strong>Business Value</strong></h4>

<p>Since the errors are known to us, we train ourselves or even the users to ignore them. It is easy to justify that fixing them does not have any business value as there is no direct impact. This assumption need not be true. If a piece of code has no value then why is it there in the first place? Possibly it is not having any visible effects at present but might be having an impact at a later point in time. It could also be that it is not affecting the data consistency of your system, but is a problem for an external system. There can be business flows that are written at a later point of time not being aware of this known error. Some developer time gets lost when glancing over such errors or messages in the log which directly equates to money for the business.</p>

<h4><strong>Important Errors Missed</strong></h4>

<p>If there are a lot of such known errors, it is easy for new or important ones to get missed or ignored. Depending on the frequency of the known error, it can end up flooding the logs. The logs start to get overwhelming to monitor or trace for other issues with lots of such known errors. The natural tendency for people when they find something overwhelming is to ignore it. I worked on a system which had over 250 failed messages coming to the error queue daily. It was overwhelming to monitor them and was soon getting ignored. Important errors were getting missed and often ended up as support requests for the application. Such errors otherwise could have been proactively handled, giving the end user more confidence.</p>

<h4><strong>Lower Perceived Stability</strong></h4>

<p>The overall perceived stability of the system comes down as more and more such errors happen. It is applicable both for the users and developers. When errors no longer get monitored or tracked, critical errors gets ignored. Users have to resort to other means like support requests for the errors they face. For users who are new to the system, it might take a while to get used to the known errors. These errors decrease the trust they have in the system and soon starts suspecting everything as an issue or a problem.</p>

<p>Seeing more and more of such errors does not leave a positive impact on the developers. It&rsquo;s possible that developers loose interest to work on an unstable system and start looking for a change. It is also a challenge when new members join the team. It takes time for them to get used to errors and exceptions and to learn to ignore them.</p>

<h4><strong>Stereotyping Exceptions</strong></h4>

<p>Errors of a particular type can get stereotyped together, and get ignored mistaking it for one that is already known. It is easy for different &lsquo;<em>object null reference exception</em>&rsquo; error messages to be treated as a particular error whereas it could be failing for various reasons. At one of my clients, we had a specific message type failing with the null reference error. We had identified the reason for one such message and found that it is not causing &lsquo;<em>any direct business impact</em>&rsquo; and can be ignored. The message was failing as one of the properties on the message was alphanumeric while the code expected numeric. The simple fix in the code would be to validate it, but since this was not causing any business impact it was ignored, and messages of that type kept piling up. Until later where we found that there were other message formats of the same message type failing which was for a different reason. And those messages were causing a loss of revenue to the business. But since we were stereotyping the error messages of the particular type to the one that we found invalid and not having a business impact all of such messages were ignored. The stereotyping resulted in the important message getting ignored.</p>

<h4><strong>Maintaining a Known Bugs Database</strong></h4>

<p>When having a large number of such errors, it is important to document a list of such errors.It forces us to a new document and also comes with the responsibility of maintaining it. For any new developers or users joining the system, they need to go through the documentation to verify if it is a known error or not. Internalizing these errors might take some time, and critical errors can get missed during this time. Any such document needs to be kept current and up to date as and when new errors are found or more details found for older ones. This is not the best of places where a developers time is spent.</p>

<h4><strong>Count Keeps Increasing</strong></h4>

<p>If the count of such errors is not monitored and not valued for the probability of the number of error messages increasing is higher. New errors getting introduced will not be noticed, and even when noticed it becomes acceptable. <em>We already have a lot of them, so it is fine.</em> It sets a wrong goal for the team and can soon become unmanageable.</p>

<h4><strong>New Business Flow Assuming Exception</strong>s</h4>

<p>Since the exceptions are so used to, it is highly possible that we set that as an expectation. New business flows come up expecting a certain kind of exception to be thrown or assuming a particular type of message will not get processed. Since we are so used to the fact that it happens, we take it for granted and start coding against it. It might be the last thing that happens on a project, but believe me, it happens!. Such code becomes harder to maintain and might not work once the actual exception gets fixed.</p>

<p>Ignoring exceptions and getting around to live with it can be more costly over a longer period. The further we delay action on such errors the higher the cost involved. Even though there is no immediate or direct business value seen from fixing such errors, we saw that on a longer run it could have a great impact. So try not to live with such errors but instead prioritize them with the work your team is doing and get it fixed. A fix might not always be an extra null check or a conditional to avoid the error. It might seem the easier approach to reducing the errors but will soon become a different problem. Understand the business and explore into what is causing the error. Do you have any known exceptions in the application you are working? What are you doing about it?</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Learnings from The Professional Scrum Master (PSM) Course]]></title>
    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/psm-learnings/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/psm-learnings</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month I attended the Professional Scrum Master (PSM) training. <a href="https://twitter.com/rbanks54">Richard Banks</a> was the training instructor who also happens to be my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">colleague at Readify</a>. It is a two days training and was a great experience for me. It changed my perception towards Scrum. Before the training, I was not that fascinated about Scrum and often argued against it citing that it&rsquo;s development practices that we need to uphold more and not Scrum. After the training, I have still not changed on the latter part but have changed my perception towards Scrum. Here are some of the key takeaways for me from the training.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Stick to the Process</li>
<li>Make Daily Scrum (a.k.a Standup) effective by setting mini goals</li>
<li>Understand the different Roles and imbibe the responsibilities</li>
<li>Have a well-defined Definition for Done</li>
<li>Deliver value in every sprint</li>
<li>Foster team collaboration and openness</li>
<li>Scrum is not the Silver Bullet. Other development practices must be followed in parallel.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are completely new to Scrum or not so familiar with the different terms used I recommend that you read <a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">The Scrum Guide</a>. Don&rsquo;t refrain from clicking that link thinking it is a long book. It is a short one, and you can finish it in less than an hour. It is an hour well spent!</p>

<p><img alt="Scrum Framework" src="/images/scrum_framework.png" /></p>

<h3>Sticking to the Process</h3>

<p>Everyone who was attending the training was already using Scrum, <em>but..</em> This is one of the common things with mostly everything and specifically with Scrum. People take parts of it and change the system to suit their needs. This is fine as long as you have tried the original process long enough to understand the pros and cons of it.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Tweaking the process to suit existing practices as soon as you start with a new process is just <strong>resistance to change</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Like Uncle Bob Martin says in clean code, dedicate yourself to the process and follow it religiously until you have mastered the process. You can start modifying the process or finding new ways once you have reached that state. But till then follow it religiously if you want to see any benefit.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Martial artists do not all agree about the best martial art, or the best technique within a martial art. Often master martial artists will form their own schools of thought and gather students to learn from them. So we see Gracie Jiu Jistu, founded and taught by the Gracie family in Brazil. We see Hakkoryu Jiu Jistu, founded and taught by Okuyama Ryuho in Tokyo. We see Jeet Kune Do, founded and taught by Bruce Lee in the United States.</em></p>

<p><em>Students of these approaches immerse themselves in the teachings of the founder.They dedicate themselves to learn what that particular master teaches, often to the exclusion of any other master’s teaching. Later, as the students grow in their art, they may become the student of a different master so they can broaden their knowledge and practice. Some eventually go on to refine their skills, discovering new techniques and founding their own schools. None of these different schools is absolutely right. Yet within a particular school we act as though the teachings and techniques are right. After all, there is a right way to practice Hakkoryu Jiu Jitsu, or Jeet Kune Do. But this rightness within a school does not invalidate the teachings of a different school.</em></p>

<p><em>-Uncle Bob Martin, <a href="http://amzn.to/2kCHgVz">Clean Code</a></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Effectiveness of Daily Scrum</h3>

<p>Daily Scrum or otherwise popular as Standup meetings are <strong>not about standing up to give status updates</strong>. The intent of the Daily Scrum is for the development team to get together and work out whatever is required to get closer to the goal set for the sprint. Standing up improves your activity levels and interaction levels. So it&rsquo;s recommended to stand up. The primary intent of the fifteen minutes time-boxed event (it can take no more than the allotted time) is to look at how we tracked on with our &lsquo;mini goals&rsquo; from last daily scrum and setting new &lsquo;mini goals&rsquo; till next stand up. Also, capture any impediments or blockers and make sure that there are assigned people following up on it. The daily scrum necessarily needs not be the first thing in the morning but is usually preferred. Currently, I am on an evening 4 pm daily scrum.</p>

<h3>Roles and Their Importance</h3>

<p>Understanding of the different roles in Scrum is necessary. A scrum team consists of</p>

<ul>
<li>The Product Owner</li>
<li>Scrum Master</li>
<li>Development team</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><em>Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Most important is to understand the responsibilities of each role and adhere to it as much as possible. Remember Sticking to the Process is important. Each of the roles must have the courage and openness to act according to their role responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Definition of Done</h3>

<p>Having a prior agreed on Definition of Done is important to decide when a piece of work is done. Having a common understanding of the definition of done ensures that we do not ship half-baked features. It also provides a guide for non-functional features, which often gets sidelined or missed and later becomes a show-stopper.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of “Done” will expand to include more stringent criteria for higher quality. Any one product or system should have a definition of “Done” that is a standard for any work done on it.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Delivering Value</h3>

<p>One of the golden rules is that every sprint must produce an increment that adds some business value. It need not be released to production, but it must be production ready. The Product Owner makes release decisions.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This hints that having sprints solely for handling Technical debts, Refactoring, Project setup, Infrastructure setup, etc. are not recommended.</p>

<h3>Team collaboration and Effectiveness</h3>

<p>The process heavily depends on the people encompassing The Scrum Team. So it is important to have a good rapport amongst the team members. The team members should be comfortable and open with each other. The team needs to be self-organizing. When starting with Scrum, this might not be the case, and the team must recognize this and work towards self-organizing. The Scrum Master must encourage and guide the team to reach that state of independence.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>When the values of commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of <strong>transparency, inspection, and adaptation</strong> come to life and build trust for everyone.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><img alt="Scrum Values" src="/images/scrum_values.png" /></p>

<p>The Scrum Guide calls out the above five core values that a team should demonstrate for the effectiveness of the framework. The Scrum team should constantly try to demonstrate these core values and try to improve on this.</p>

<h3>Not the Silver Bullet for Development</h3>

<blockquote><p><em>There&rsquo;s a mess I&rsquo;ve heard about with quite a few projects recently. It works out like this:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>They want to use an agile process, and pick Scrum</em></li>
<li><em>They adopt the Scrum practices, and maybe even the principles</em></li>
<li><em>After a while progress is slow because the code base is a mess</em></li>
</ul>


<p> <em>-Martin Fowler, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html">Flaccid Scrum</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>If you are looking up to Scrum to solve the problems with the quality of code you are delivering, you are with the wrong process. Scrum does not talk anything specific about software development and related practices. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">Extreme Programming</a> is one process that is specific to coding and software development and is also a type of agile software development. It talks about the various development practices lays down strict rules <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">related to software development</a>. Again if you decide to follow this do that religiously - Sticking to the Process matters. Picking up only certain aspects of different school of thoughts might not provide the desired output always. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/is-code-coverage-a-lie/">Code Coverage</a> if one such practice that is picked up in isolation and seen to produce not much value.</p>

<p>Given these new insights, I now feel that following a proven process framework, like Scrum will help a team achieve its goals. The core values that Scrum lays down is important for any team. From my personal experience, the reason why I used to look down upon Scrum is that it was not practiced the way it was laid out. Like in software development premature optimization of the process is likely to give less value. The training provided a lot of new insights and helped me to have a better understanding of the Scrum process framework. I did the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-certifications/professional-scrum-master-i-assessment">PSM I</a> and <a href="https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-certifications/professional-scrum-product-owner-i-assessment">PSPO I</a> (I had attended this training last year but never took the test until now) assessment and got certified.  Are you using Scrum, what are your experiences?</p>

    <updated>2017-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/recording-my-first-screencast</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Screencast helps to connect with people in a different way and adds a personal touch (sound and visual). It makes learning new things faster, by seeing it in action. Most of the fine details (which can be missed while writing a blog post) get captured in screencasting and this helps in better understanding. I have been long wanting to create screencasts and start a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RahulNath">YouTube channel</a>. Finally, this <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/2016-recap/">happened in 2016</a> and here is how the recording experience went.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast">screencast</a> is a digital recording of computer screen output, also known as a video screen capture, often containing audio narration.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Presentation</h3>

<p>I chose to do my first screencast as a slide share presentation, as it was something that I was comfortable with. Since there are not many videos on <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/azure-key-vault/">Azure Key Vault</a> and I have been blogging extensively about it, I didn&rsquo;t have to think twice about the topic. I scripted the whole presentation, to every word that I would say. Scripting for a video is different from writing a blog post as it has to be conversational with a video. Also, there are a lot more details that need to be covered and talked about as it is all visible on the recording.</p>

<p>Since I did not have an external monitor I wanted a presentation application that allows presenter notes and syncs them across multiple devices. This would allow me to record the screen and read off the presenter notes side by side. <a href="http://slides.com/">Slides</a> had exactly what I wanted. It allows to add presenter notes for each slide and allows <a href="http://help.slides.com/knowledgebase/articles/333925-remote-control">remote controlling</a> the presentation from multiple devices. So I can launch it as a full-screen presentation on my laptop for recording screen and have an iPad or mobile launch the same presentation as a presenter where the notes show up. This helped me follow the script while recording the video. It would have been much easier with multiple monitors, but I just did not want to get one just for this and I have been trying to get used with a single screen. Alternatively, I could have taken a printout of the script.</p>

<h3>Microphone</h3>

<p>An external microphone is absolutely necessary to record your sound well. The microphone that comes built into the laptop is not suited for recording good quality audio. It picks a lot more of the background noises, room noise, typing etc and creates a lot of disturbance in the recording. There are a lot of options available when it comes to getting an external microphone. Most of the microphones are either <a href="http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/best-condenser-mics/">Condenser Mics</a> or <a href="http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/dynamic-studio-microphone/">Dynamic Mics</a>. Microphones also have different connectivity options like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLR_connector">XLR</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB">USB</a> etc. For a home recording setup USB is easier to get started with so I decided to get one with a <a href="http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/usb-microphones/">USB connectivity</a>.</p>

<p>I got the <a href="http://www.rode.com/microphones/podcaster">Rode Podcaster</a> with a <a href="http://www.rode.com/accessories/psa1">boom arm</a> and <a href="http://www.rode.com/accessories/psm1">shock mount</a>. The Rode Podcaster is a dynamic USB mic and is a popular choice amongst many people out there. It&rsquo;s a bit higher on the price side (depends on your budget though) but delivers great value. It cuts off most of the room noise and takes in only your voice which is exactly what I wanted. You need to get really close into the mic, so a boom arm helps.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>Choosing the software was much easier than getting the microphone. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/au/products/premiere.html?sdid=VBF1KRFN&amp;mv=search&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!107609177344!e!!g!!adobe%20premiere&amp;ef_id=Ve-MSAAABFDV-qvS:20170101175215:s">Adobe Premiere</a> or <a href="http://shop.techsmith.com/store/techsm/en_AU/pd/productID.289432000">Camtasia</a> are the most popular screen recording software&rsquo;s in the windows world. I have a lot of friends already using Camtasia and was happy with it. So I decided to stick with Camtasia and bought a license (Thanks to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">Readify&rsquo;s</a> Software Allowance, I did not have to spend a lot from my pocket).</p>

<p>For recording audio, I use <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, which is an open source software and available free of cost. I am yet to learn some audio processing techniques and for now just use noise removal, amplify and compression. Also since the Rode microphone does not pick a lot of external noise the audio did not require much processing. At first, I tried recording with a <a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/gomic/">Samson GO mic</a> but felt that it picked it a lot more room noise and it needed a lot more audio processing.</p>

<h3>Recording</h3>

<p>With the hardware and software sorted now comes the hardest part of it all - Recording!!. I knew there would be difficulties along the way, but never thought it would be this hard. After reading around I understood that a popular technique that people use for recording is to record the audio and video separately for webcasts/screen recordings. I decide to take the same approach but just that did it in the wrong order (which I found after the first recording). For my first video I did the video first and the audio later. This meant that I recorded my screen performing all the slide movements and the code sample demo and then tried to fit the audio onto it. This was the biggest mistake in my complete recording, but I realized it only towards the end of the recording. Recording video was easy but fitting in the sound to it was hard. I had to do multiple (innumerous) takes and have to stop so often every now and then. And since I am yet to learn <em>how to talk naturally when in front of a microphone</em>, my voice was all over the place. Some bits had more bass, some a bit low others high, some fast others slow. I struggled with it for a long time and finally somehow got to get it all together. But though it was nowhere close to the quality that I set out for or would love to have in videos that I watch, I decided to ship it. For the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbshGF4ZwGE">second recording</a>, I recorded the audio first and then fitted in the video onto it. This was so much easier and I have a more consistent voice in that, though there is a noticeable change in the middle.</p>

<p>I am planning to do more recordings in the upcoming months so that I get more comfortable with it. <strong><em>If it hurts, do it more often</em></strong>. Kindly leave your feedback on the videos.</p>
