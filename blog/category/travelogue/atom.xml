<h3><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/three-day-trip-to-coffs-harbour-from-sydney/">Coffs Harbour</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/three-day-trip-to-coffs-harbour-from-sydney/">Coffs Harbour</a> is one of the places that I liked the most of all my trips. It&rsquo;s been almost a year since I made my trip and the memories are still fresh. The beaches are great, especially the Jetty Beach. The rainforest walk in Dorrigo was the best I have had to date, especially because of the rain the night before. Coffs Harbour is perfect for a 3-4 days trip and there are a lot of places to visit around.</p>

<p><img alt="Jetty Beach, Coffs Harbour" src="/images/coffs_harbour_jetty_beach_toys.jpg" /></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.portmacquarieinfo.com.au/">Port Macquarie</a></h3>

<p>We headed off to Port Macquarie to celebrate Gauthams birthday. Gautham likes strawberries a lot which was why we chose Port Macquarie. <a href="http://www.ricardoes.com/">Ricardoes Tomatoes &amp; Strawberries</a> is located just ten minutes north of Port Macquarie and provides a unique experience for picking your own strawberries. You can spend around 2-3 hours here and make sure you don&rsquo;t miss the scones from the cafe. Port Macquarie is also a great place for whale watching and we headed off on an early morning trip to be with the whales. The boat ride (<a href="https://www.portjet.com.au/">PortJet</a>) in itself is an experience and to our luck, we were able to see around 3 whales up close. We also went to Dooragan National Park, Kattang, Perpendicular Point and Charles Hamsey lookout.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.grandpacificdrive.com.au/">Grand Pacific Drive</a></h3>

<p>The Grand Pacific Drive makes a great one day trip as well as a multi-day trip for those who want to take their time along this stretch of land. Starting from Royal National Park and stretching all the way to Sapphire Coast, this makes a great drive with beautiful scenery and also a lot of places to visit. The <a href="http://www.grandpacificdrive.com.au/">Grand Pacific Drive</a> site has all the details that you need to plan your trip. It also has a trip planner that makes planning easier. If you want to cover most of the places along the way during a single trip, it is best to give it 2-3 days. During my trip, I stopped over at Wollongong and only made my way till Kiama.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.grandpacificdrive.com.au/">

</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/blue-mountains?nst=0">Blue Mountains</a></h3>

<p>Just 90 minutes from Sydney by car, the Blue Mountains has a lot of attractions worth visiting, making it a good place for an extended weekend trip. Wentworth Falls, Echo Point, and Three Sisters are some of the popular lookouts. <a href="https://www.scenicworld.com.au/">Scenic World</a> offers some good rides and entertainment for kids. I liked the worlds steepest incline railway ride in particular. The entry tickets are a bit overpriced though.</p>

<p><img alt="Three Sisters, Blue Mountains" class="center" src="/images/three_sisters_blue_mountains.jpg" /></p>

<p>Jenolan Caves is another one hour drive from the Blue Mountains and is a must-do. It&rsquo;s great for people of all ages and if you have kids they will love it. Make sure you check the different <a href="http://www.jenolancaves.org.au/">cave options</a> and choose one that fits the people in your group. Booking a spot in advance might help and make sure you arrive on time. The drive up there might be a bit slower so give enough buffer time before your cave walk starts.</p>

<h3><a href="https://visitcanberra.com.au/">Canberra</a></h3>

<p>Unlike Sydney, Canberra is a planned city and you can tell that from the moment you enter it. It&rsquo;s a beautiful little city with lots of variety of things to visit. We started off with the <a href="https://www.cockingtongreen.com.au/">Cockington Green Gardens</a> followed by the <a href="http://nationaldinosaurmuseum.com.au/">National Dinosaur museum</a>. You can spend almost half a day with these and try out the <a href="https://visitcanberra.com.au/eat-and-drink/57031e8c5d234a7604ea80b2/the-hamlet">Hamlet, Food Trucks</a>. The <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Visit_Parliament">Parliment House</a> and <a href="https://www.awm.gov.au/">Australian War Memorial</a> is also worth visiting. If you time your visit during September-October you can also see the <a href="https://visitcanberra.com.au/events/56b23aea266140594567dbbe/floriade">Floriade</a> - the tulip flower festival.</p>

<p><img alt="Floriade Tulip Festival, Canberra" class="center" src="/images/canberra_tulip_festival.jpg" /></p>

<p>Nelson Bay, Hunter Valley, Orange, Port Stephens etc are some of the places that are on our list but could not make it yet. I moved over to Brisbane end of last year and not sure when I will have another chance to explore more around Sydney. But I have new places to look forward to now - Exploring Brisbane!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Australia is known for its beaches, and there are a plenty of them all around.

<h3><a href="http://www.grandpacificdrive.com.au/">Grand Pacific Drive</a></h3>

<p>The Grand Pacific Drive makes a perfect day out with one of the best drives and perfect scenery along the route. It starts from Royal National Park through Wollongong, Shellharbour, Kiama, Shoalhaven, Southern Highlands, Eurobodalla and ending at Sapphire Coast. Each one of those places have things enough to spend a whole day. You can either choose to do the entire drive or do each of these places on separate day trips.
The <a href="http://www.grandpacificdrive.com.au/">Grand Pacific Drive</a> site has all the details that you need to plan your trip. It also has a trip planner that makes planning easier.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.grandpacificdrive.com.au/">
    <img src="/images/sydney_trip_gpd.png" class="center" alt="Grand Pacific Drive" />
</a></p>

<p>Do make it one day for the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BUoLoKYj2B3/?taken-by=rahulpnath">sun rise at the Sea Cliff bridge</a>. It&rsquo;s amazing and worth waking up early enough to make it up there on time.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/country-nsw/southern-highlands/fitzroy-falls/attractions">Fitzroy Falls</a></h3>

<p>As the name suggests, the Fitzroy Falls spots a magnificent waterfall with a nice walking track along the sides. There are various lookouts to the waterfall along the walking track. There is also a cycling track from the falls to Kangaroo Valley for those interested.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sydney_trip_fitzroy_falls.jpg" class="center" alt="Fitzroy Falls" /></p>

<h3><a href="http://visitkangaroovalley.com.au/">Kangaroo Valley</a></h3>

<p>Kangaroo Valley is a two-hour drive from Sydney and is popular for kayaking, canoeing, golf and wine tasting. You can take a break and play on the banks of the Kangaroo River. Do check out the <a href="http://kangaroovalleyfudge.com.au/">Fudge House</a> if you have a sweet tooth and the <a href="http://worldsbestpies.com.au/">pie shop</a> for a quick snack.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.audleyboatshed.com/">Audley Boating</a></h3>

<p>Situated in the Royal National Park, Audley boating provides a great experience along the Kangaroo Creek. You can hire a boat or ride a bike and enjoy the magnificent views.</p>

<h3><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/r9Wup35pVFR2">Morriset Park</a></h3>

<p>If you want to see Kangaroos, then this is the place you should be. You can get close up with kangaroos and hundreds of them. It&rsquo;s an experience that no zoo can provide. One of the Kangaroo spotting points is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/r9Wup35pVFR2">near the Morriset Hospital</a>. Even on a rainy day, there were plenty of them so I am sure you would not miss out on it. There are a few other parks and places as well nearby where you can take a stroll and stand a chance of spotting one.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sydney_trip_morriset_park.png" class="center" alt="Morriset Park, Kangaroos" /></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.watkinsfamilyfarm.com.au/">Mandarin Picking</a></h3>

<p>Situated on the banks of Hawkesbury River at Wisemans Ferry there are a couple of farms where you can go picking mandarins. I had been to the <a href="http://www.watkinsfamilyfarm.com.au/">Watkins Family Farm</a> and enjoyed every bit of it. It&rsquo;s great fun for kids and equally for adults. We ended up going back there twice in the same season. Make sure you check the farm sites for details on timing and months they are open.</p>

<p>There are a few other picnic spots as well around the area. There is a <a href="http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/roads/using-roads/vehicular-ferries/index.html#Wisemansferry">vehicle ferry service</a> to take your vehicle across the river and explore that side as well.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.calmsleyhill.com.au/">Animal Farm (Kids)</a></h3>

<p>If you have kids, then a day out at one of the animal farms around Sydney is an excellent way to spend your day. Google should help you find the farms around you. The <a href="http://www.calmsleyhill.com.au/">Calmsley Hill</a> animal farm is a family friendly environment with <a href="http://www.calmsleyhill.com.au/visitor-information/daily-show-times">daily shows</a>, picnic and BBQ area. They often run some <a href="http://www.calmsleyhill.com.au/city-farm/web-deal">online offers</a> so make sure you check that out before you head off.</p>

<h3><a href="https://taronga.org.au/taronga-zoo">Taronga Zoo</a></h3>

<p>The zoo is always a great place to spend time. The <a href="https://taronga.org.au/taronga-zoo">Taronga Zoo</a> experience is no different. If you have not taken the Sydney Ferries before this is a good excuse to do that. It&rsquo;s really big, and there are a lot of shows as well. Do check out the show times prior and plan for it upfront. It can be crowded at times. If you have kids getting an annual pass to the zoo might be worth.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/">Illawarra Fly Treetops</a></h3>

<p>Escape into the trees at the <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/">Illawarra Fly Treetops</a> and enjoy the stunning views and the zipline experience. It is a perfect place for a day trip and equal fun for families. It offers a breath taking views and a great experience. Check out for <a href="https://illawarrafly.experienceoz.com.au/en/sydney/illawarra-fly-treetop-walk-online-ticketing">online offers</a>!</p>

<p><img src="/images/sydney_trip_illawara.png" class="center" alt="Illawara Fly Treetop" /></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.nantien.org.au/en/">Nan tien temple</a></h3>

<p>The Nan Tien Temple is the largest Buddhist temple in the Southern Hemisphere. It&rsquo;s a calm and peaceful place and a nice spot to take your day off and relax. The temple offers <a href="http://www.nantien.org.au/en/services">many services</a> including a guided tour. They run various retreats and meditation classes if you are interested. You can either choose to spend a whole day here or spend a few hours on the way to Illawarra Fly Tree Tops.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/visit-a-park/parks/kuringgai-chase-national-park">Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park</a></h3>

<p> Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park combines important history with scenic beauty, making it perfect for a day out for families and kids. There are great picnic areas, heritage walks, lighthouse, boating, etc. There are not many shops around so get all that you need on the way.</p>

<h3><a href="http://theentrance.org.au/">The Entrance, Central Coast</a></h3>

<p>Even though the main attraction here is a beach, there still are enough things other than that to make your trip worth while. Tuggerah Lakes Cycleway is an off-road, scenic 12-kilometre ride and is perfect to spend some time. Don&rsquo;t miss out on the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4cA463PzD3U2">Pelican Feeding</a> which happens at 3:30 pm every day all round the year.</p>

<p>These places make a perfect getaway for a day. Mix it up with some of the awesome beaches - Bondi, Palm, Wattamolla, La Perouse, Coogee, Ramsgate, Cronulla, etc. and it should be enough to keep all your weekends busy. What places did I miss? Sound off in the comments.</p>

<p>Have great weekends ahead!</p>

    <updated>2017-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/three-day-trip-to-coffs-harbour-from-sydney</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the Australia Day (and Indian Republic Day) falling on a Thursday I got a long weekend by taking the Friday off. Me, Parvathy (my wife) and Gautham (my son) decided to head off to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Tb4awz6cx6H2">Coffs Harbour</a>, which is a six-hour drive from Sydney. We started off at six, Thursday morning.</p>

<p>This was the first time Parvathy, and I was doing a road trip this long with Gautham and had no idea what to expect. Gautham was wide awake from the start of the trip till we reached Coffs Harbour. But it was all right traveling with him. The trip was also the first since he was fully toilet-trained. We did stop at 3 places on the way but were happy to do that. We stopped for breakfast at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/H72Loz9zofk">Hungry Jack&rsquo;s, Beresfield</a> and had quick burger, fries and hash brown. We continued to have this same breakfast throughout the trip, for it was fast and enabled to get on with the day quickly. Deciding, ordering and eating at a cafe is much more time-consuming. After two more stops, we reached Coffs Harbour by two in the noon. Since both me and Parvathy are trying to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/">eat healthy (since a month)</a>, we decided to keep our lunch light. Mostly we had carrots, cucumber, and some nuts. For Gautham, we usually got something on the way.</p>

<h3>Day1 (Thursday)</h3>

<p>We headed straight to Royal Palms Motor Inn and dropped our bags and quickly freshened up. The weather forecast said it would rain, but luckily there was no rain and was a pleasant climate. We headed off straight to Jetty Beach, where we spent the rest of our day. The beach was calm and had a great walk by the side of it. The sand looked like a mirror, and in the beginning, Gautham was even cautious not to break it. We enjoyed the time there and stayed there till five. After having a wash down at the beach showers, we headed back to the hotel. Gautham fell asleep the moment we got into the car. We reached the hotel and stayed in the car till seven so not to disturb his sleep. Once he woke up, we headed off to Bombay Brasserie, an Indian restaurant right next to the hotel. We usually prefer other food option while eating outside to try different cuisine. But during the trip, we stuck to Indian hotels as Gautham often ends up eating more from there, as it was similar to food at home. We had a nice tandoori platter, Nan, rice and ice-cream. By half past eight, we reached back at the hotel, had a bath and went to sleep by ten.</p>

<img alt="Jetty Beach, Coffs Harbour" src="/images/coffs_harbour_jetty_beach_toys.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Day 2 (Friday)</h3>

<p>We all slept in a bit late today and woke up by seven. Luckily Parvathy was up and ready by then. After a quick fresh up, we started off to Dorrigo. Picked up our breakfast burgers on the way and headed off straight to Dorrigo. It was just over an hours drive from the hotel and a scenic one too. Dorrigo has a <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions?&amp;">lot of attractions</a>, but we just did the <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions/skywalk-lookout">Skywalk Lookout</a>, <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions/wonga-walk">Wonga Walk</a>, <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions/walk-the-birds-boardwalk">Walk with The Birds Boardwalk</a> and <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions/dangar-falls">Dangar Falls</a>. We spent half a day there covering all these. The lookout and the walks were superb. It was a pleasant walk in the forest as it had rained the night before. By the time we headed back, Gautham was fast asleep after having a delicious cake with cream and juice. Woolgoolga was the next stop and was around one and half hours away. By three in the evening, we hit the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1fBYqWHDnyC2">beach</a>. By five we headed back to the hotel. On the way, we drove through <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Pm7jh9nJRCM2">Emerald beach</a> to the hotel. After a quick fresh up we set out for dinner by six. We tried a different Indian restaurant today and ate to our full. By ten we hit the bed.</p>

<img alt="Dorrigo Lookout, Coffs Harbour" src="/images/coffs_harbout_dorrigo_lookout.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Day 3 (Saturday)</h3>

<p>I woke up at half past five and went for a run. I <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/users/4b76cfab-734e-1658-b5e4-600759a3b066/sport-sessions/588ba8d079a46318f38e5d10">ran by the boat jetty to jetty beach and through the Coffs Coast State Park</a>. The route was scenic, and I enjoyed it.By seven I was at the hotel and got ready to checkout. We checked out by eight, grabbed a <a href="http://www.boostjuice.com.au/products">Boost smoothie</a> and burger and headed off to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/P9e9sx5eib62">Sawtell beach</a>. It was a hot day, and the sun was already up and high. We just had a quick walk by the beach side and headed straight to <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/nambucca-heads">Nambucca heads</a> as we wanted to spend more time there. The walk by the Nambucca river is excellent. You can see the river meeting the sea here, and it is a beautiful sight. The river is calm and up to waist height and we can easily walk. We spent around two hours there and started our way back home at around one in the noon. It is around six hours drive, and with a couple of stops along the way, we reached home by eight in the evening.</p>

<p><img alt="Nambucca Heads, Coffs Harbour" src="/images/coffs_harbour_nambucca_heads.jpg" /></p>

<p>It was a good three-day break and completely disconnected from work and social media. It was refreshing, and the drive was great too. This was our first long drive after coming to Sydney and enjoyed it.</p>
