    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Getting fit is one of the goals that I have set for myself this year. I have started running since mid of December and also controlling my diet.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>DISCLAIMER!</strong> I am not a doctor or a dietitian. The below are just my personal experiences and has worked for me. If you feel you have a medical problem or are in need of professional help, please contact a professional. Always consult a doctor before starting a new diet or exercise program.

<blockquote><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Have Parvathy (my wife) support me throughout.</li>
<li>Running 1-2 times a week</li>
<li>No carbs till Dinner: Smoothie, Veggies, and nuts till dinner. Dinner is Chappathi and curry (mostly vegetables).</li>
<li>150+ Pushups Daily, spread across the day</li>
<li>No Sugar</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I was around 95 kilos when I started out in December. At the time of writing, I weigh 82 kilos. Yes, I have lost 13 kilos over the past one and half months. This is the first time I have seen such drastic changes in my body, and I believe it&rsquo;s because of the strict diet more than anything. Below are the various aspects of what I have been following.</p>

<p><figure>
    <img alt="Before and After" src="/images/weigth_Before and After.jpg" />

<h3>Exercises</h3>

<p> I started with running once a week. But now I am so into it I try to run two to three times a week. I use <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/users/4b76cfab-734e-1658-b5e4-600759a3b066">Runtastic</a> to track my runs. Last week I purchased the premium plan for Runtastic and looking forward to starting one of their 10k <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/training-plans/10k">training plans</a> and <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/results">runtastic results</a> on days that I do not run. I use a <a href="https://www.bose.com.au/en_au/products/headphones/earphones/soundsport-in-ear-headphones-audio.html#v=soundsport_ie_headphones_ii_audio_charcoal">Bose SoundSport in-ear audio only headphones</a>  headphones (the cheapest in their range) for music during the runs. Luckily Bose was running a half price on those models when I purchased.</p>

<p> I do push-ups every day and get 150+ (25 * 6+) every day. I split this out throughout the day - 75 before I head off to work and 75 once back. I get enough time in the morning to space it at 30-minute intervals as I <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">wake up at four</a>. I plan to replace push-ups with Runtastic Results starting next week.</p>

<p> <img alt="My Running History" src="/images/weight_running.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Diet</h3>

<p>Breakfast (<em>7:30 am</em>): Green Smoothie (+ eggs on days that I run) or Avocado and eggs.
Lunch (<em>12 pm</em>): Raw vegetables (Carrot, Cucumber, spinach, kale, beetroot, corn, sprouts)
Dinner (<em>6:30 pm</em>: Wheat Dosa or Chappathi + Vegetable Curry
Snacks: Anytime I feel hungry I have one of these - Nuts (Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, etc.), Carrot, Banana and Peanut butter. Usually, I end up having just the nuts at around 10 30 in the morning.</p>

<p><img alt="Diet" src="/images/weight_diet.jpg" /></p>

<p>When eating out, I keep an eye on carbs and other junk. Try to eat grilled instead of fried. Usually, we eat out on weekends as we will be traveling places. We usually have a hearty lunch on weekends. Parvathy and I decided to have fruits for dinner on those days. I try to take fruits that contain less sugar like kiwi, berries, etc. But we do have apples, mangoes, watermelon, etc. but in moderation. The fruit choices are more driven by what&rsquo;s available at the place <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">I live now</a>.</p>

<p>Sugar: I try my best to avoid it fully. To start with I quit tea and coffee. Believe me, I was a tea addict and I needed lots of it. It was hard, but then Parvathy quit it one day, and I got inspired by her. I still remember that last tea I took when I decided I am having no more of it. It&rsquo;s hard but doable!. I don&rsquo;t have any ice-cream, fruit juice, carbonated drinks, energy drinks, pastries, etc.</p>

<h3>Family Outings</h3>

<p>We used to spend a lot of our weekends in shopping malls till a while back. We decided to change that to more of outdoor activities. So it&rsquo;s either the beach, boating, parks, walks, etc. This has increased our general activity levels and help burn extra calories. And mostly I have &lsquo;an extra weight&rsquo; to carry around; you can tell that from the photos :). Gautham also enjoys these outdoor activities, and there&rsquo;s more for him to learn in each of those short trips. On weekdays we go for a walk after dinner, shop around for groceries, etc. and run any other errands so that we are free during weekends.</p>

<p>With the new routine, I now feel great to be back in shape. I have never been this light since a long time, and I am happy to be in clothes that I had locked up in my bags. Since the new routine takes an hour out of <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">my morning routine</a> I have to optimize myself further to keep up with blogging, videos and learning new things. I am still trying to find a balance but for this. Hoping to continue with this new routine.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/cmder-portable-console-emulator-for-windows/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/cmder-portable-console-emulator-for-windows</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center;">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fpxx8hlNTzc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<p>I have been using Cmder as my command line for around two years and been loving it. I am not a super user of the command line, but try to use it more and more.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of good console emulator on Windows. It is based on ConEmu with major config overhaul, comes with a Monokai color scheme, and a custom prompt layout.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This is not right with Windows 10, as there is a new command prompt which has a lot more features. I have not yet thought of moving to that as Cmder has been working well for me.</p>

<h4><strong>Installation and setting up</strong></h4>

<p>Cmder is open source and free to download from <a href="http://cmder.net/">Cmder.net</a>. One of the advantages of Cmder is its portability. You can carry it with you on a USB stick or in the Cloud, so all your settings can go anywhere you go. Installation is simple, all you need to do is download the latest release, extract the archive and run Cmder executable. Check out the documentation if you face any difficulties.</p>

<h4><strong>Features I Like</strong></h4>

<p>Able to <strong><em>paste into the console using the Windows shortcut Ctrl + V</em></strong> is one of the key things that got me started with this command line tool. It also supports most of the other text traversal keyboard shortcuts of Windows.</p>

<p>Cmder supports <strong><em>multiple console tabs within a window</em></strong>. Tabs makes having multiple consoles open and managing them easy. All tab manipulation has associated keyboard shortcuts making it even faster. When creating a new tab, using Ctrl + T, you can choose to run different predefined tasks on command line startup. You can also set the user and user rights to run them as. Setting up the predefined tasks is under Settings -> Startup->Tasks.  I have added <strong><em>custom tasks</em></strong> for PowerShell, and Visual Studio developer command prompt as that is what I use mostly.</p>

<div id="customtasks" ></div>


<pre><code class="text Powershell Administrator Task">*PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NoProfile -NoExit -Command 
"Invoke-Expression '. ''%ConEmuDir%\..\profile.ps1'''" -new_console:d:"%USERPROFILE%"
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text Visual Studio Developer Prompt Task">cmd /k ""%ConEmuDir%\..\init.bat" &amp; 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat"" 
-new_console:d:%USERPROFILE%
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Alias</em></strong> is one of the key features that keeps me to Cmder. You can create short commands to map to longer commands. Aliases avoid typing long commands every time you want to perform that action. You can see all existing aliases by running alias command. I use this feature a lot. Most of the git commands are aliases, so I do not have to type them every time. For e.g., when on a git repository I can type <em>gs</em> to run git status. You can also pass arguments to alias. To do a git commit with a message I run <em>gc The commit message</em>. Aliases support optional parameters through the $1-9 or the $*.</p>

<p>To define a alias <em>alias gs=git status</em>. Below are some of the alias examples.</p>

<pre><code class="text Alias Examples">gl=git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate  $*
gs=git status
ga=git add -A
gc=git commit -m "$*"
gcb=git checkout -b $*
gpsu=git push --set-upstream origin $*
</code></pre>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpxx8hlNTzc">video</a> for a walk-through of the setup and its usage. Cmder allows to get things done fast and looks great. Try it out to see if it works for you.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/recording-my-first-screencast/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/recording-my-first-screencast</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Screencast helps to connect with people in a different way and adds a personal touch (sound and visual). It makes learning new things faster, by seeing it in action. Most of the fine details (which can be missed while writing a blog post) get captured in screencasting and this helps in better understanding. I have been long wanting to create screencasts and start a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RahulNath">YouTube channel</a>. Finally, this <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/2016-recap/">happened in 2016</a> and here is how the recording experience went.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast">screencast</a> is a digital recording of computer screen output, also known as a video screen capture, often containing audio narration.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Presentation</h3>

<p>I chose to do my first screencast as a slide share presentation, as it was something that I was comfortable with. Since there are not many videos on <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/azure-key-vault/">Azure Key Vault</a> and I have been blogging extensively about it, I didn&rsquo;t have to think twice about the topic. I scripted the whole presentation, to every word that I would say. Scripting for a video is different from writing a blog post as it has to be conversational with a video. Also, there are a lot more details that need to be covered and talked about as it is all visible on the recording.</p>

<p>Since I did not have an external monitor I wanted a presentation application that allows presenter notes and syncs them across multiple devices. This would allow me to record the screen and read off the presenter notes side by side. <a href="http://slides.com/">Slides</a> had exactly what I wanted. It allows to add presenter notes for each slide and allows <a href="http://help.slides.com/knowledgebase/articles/333925-remote-control">remote controlling</a> the presentation from multiple devices. So I can launch it as a full-screen presentation on my laptop for recording screen and have an iPad or mobile launch the same presentation as a presenter where the notes show up. This helped me follow the script while recording the video. It would have been much easier with multiple monitors, but I just did not want to get one just for this and I have been trying to get used with a single screen. Alternatively, I could have taken a printout of the script.</p>

<p><img alt="Using slides on multiple devices" src="/images/screencast_slides_multidevice.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Microphone</h3>

<p>An external microphone is absolutely necessary to record your sound well. The microphone that comes built into the laptop is not suited for recording good quality audio. It picks a lot more of the background noises, room noise, typing etc and creates a lot of disturbance in the recording. There are a lot of options available when it comes to getting an external microphone. Most of the microphones are either <a href="http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/best-condenser-mics/">Condenser Mics</a> or <a href="http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/dynamic-studio-microphone/">Dynamic Mics</a>. Microphones also have different connectivity options like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLR_connector">XLR</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB">USB</a> etc. For a home recording setup USB is easier to get started with so I decided to get one with a <a href="http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/usb-microphones/">USB connectivity</a>.</p>

<p>I got the <a href="http://www.rode.com/microphones/podcaster">Rode Podcaster</a> with a <a href="http://www.rode.com/accessories/psa1">boom arm</a> and <a href="http://www.rode.com/accessories/psm1">shock mount</a>. The Rode Podcaster is a dynamic USB mic and is a popular choice amongst many people out there. It&rsquo;s a bit higher on the price side (depends on your budget though) but delivers great value. It cuts off most of the room noise and takes in only your voice which is exactly what I wanted. You need to get really close into the mic, so a boom arm helps.</p>

<p><img alt="Screencast Microphone, Rode Podcaster" src="/images/screencast_microphone_rode.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>Choosing the software was much easier than getting the microphone. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/au/products/premiere.html?sdid=VBF1KRFN&amp;mv=search&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!107609177344!e!!g!!adobe%20premiere&amp;ef_id=Ve-MSAAABFDV-qvS:20170101175215:s">Adobe Premiere</a> or <a href="http://shop.techsmith.com/store/techsm/en_AU/pd/productID.289432000">Camtasia</a> are the most popular screen recording software&rsquo;s in the windows world. I have a lot of friends already using Camtasia and was happy with it. So I decided to stick with Camtasia and bought a license (Thanks to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">Readify&rsquo;s</a> Software Allowance, I did not have to spend a lot from my pocket).</p>

<p>For recording audio, I use <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, which is an open source software and available free of cost. I am yet to learn some audio processing techniques and for now just use noise removal, amplify and compression. Also since the Rode microphone does not pick a lot of external noise the audio did not require much processing. At first, I tried recording with a <a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/gomic/">Samson GO mic</a> but felt that it picked it a lot more room noise and it needed a lot more audio processing.</p>

<h3>Recording</h3>

<p>With the hardware and software sorted now comes the hardest part of it all - Recording!!. I knew there would be difficulties along the way, but never thought it would be this hard. After reading around I understood that a popular technique that people use for recording is to record the audio and video separately for webcasts/screen recordings. I decide to take the same approach but just that did it in the wrong order (which I found after the first recording). For my first video I did the video first and the audio later. This meant that I recorded my screen performing all the slide movements and the code sample demo and then tried to fit the audio onto it. This was the biggest mistake in my complete recording, but I realized it only towards the end of the recording. Recording video was easy but fitting in the sound to it was hard. I had to do multiple (innumerous) takes and have to stop so often every now and then. And since I am yet to learn <em>how to talk naturally when in front of a microphone</em>, my voice was all over the place. Some bits had more bass, some a bit low others high, some fast others slow. I struggled with it for a long time and finally somehow got to get it all together. But though it was nowhere close to the quality that I set out for or would love to have in videos that I watch, I decided to ship it. For the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbshGF4ZwGE">second recording</a>, I recorded the audio first and then fitted in the video onto it. This was so much easier and I have a more consistent voice in that, though there is a noticeable change in the middle.</p>

<p>I am planning to do more recordings in the upcoming months so that I get more comfortable with it. <strong><em>If it hurts, do it more often</em></strong>. Kindly leave your feedback on the videos.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-keyboard-shortcuts-on-websites/"/>

    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-keyboard-shortcuts-on-websites</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Keyboard Shortcuts" src="/images/keyboard_shortcuts.jpg" /></p>

<p>I prefer to use the keyboard to navigate within sites I use frequently. Keyboard enables to navigate faster within site and perform tasks quicker. The <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-six-months-and-counting-logitech-mx-master/">Logitech MX Master</a> mouse provides a lot of capabilities to navigate. But I find the keyboard faster to perform repetitive actions - like posting a new status update on social media sites, managing tasks in Jira, TFS online, GitHub, responding to emails, Todoist, etc. Finding keyboard shortcuts on these various sites can itself be a daunting task. One might need to google to get the shortcuts or find the relevant documentation on the site. Luckily most of the popular sites today display a pop-up modal with all the keyboard shortcuts for the site when pressing <strong>Shift + ?</strong>. Note that this might not work on all the sites out there. But for most of the common ones that I use l, I find it working.</p>

<p>So the next time you spend a lot of time on a website try hitting <strong>Shift + ?</strong> to look for supported keyboard shortcuts.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are the kind of person that likes to listen to some music while working, then this one is for you. Music is proven to have significant effects on improving focus while working. But it is also quite possible to get fully immersed in the music and forget all about work. Different kinds of music contribute to improving concentration while not getting immersed in the music itself. I usually <a href="http://theheadphonesrule.com/">wear my headphones</a> at work while working and listen to music.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Music helps to minimize distractions and helps you reach a state of <a href="http://amzn.to/2jlYIgV">Flow</a>, which is ideal for improving productivity.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>At times I like to hear to just some background noises simulating different environments. <a href="https://www.noisli.com/">Noisli</a> is an application that helps mix different sounds and create your perfect environment. The sounds could either be working in a restaurant or while it&rsquo;s raining with thunder, in a forest, by the side of the fire, etc. It helps create the mood that you want and helps recreate it with sound. Since the noises are of a fixed pattern, you soon get used to it and improves concentration at work.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Noisli - Favorite Combos" src="/images/noisli_favorite.png" /></p>

<p>Here are my favorite mixes in Noisli.
<a href="https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/W5rvjLZXcoJbooq">Rain Mix</a>, <a href="https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/vjUpcG2OAXxKVSU">Jungle</a>, <a href="https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/uhRXMysAIcVEbHF">TRain</a>, <a href="https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/gFKhnETdoybxcmc">HotelRainFire</a></p>

<p>You can use Noisli directly from the <a href="https://www.noisli.com/">website</a> or use any of their <a href="https://www.noisli.com/apps">Apps and Extensions</a>. Find out what works for you and leave a comment on your favorite combos.</p>
