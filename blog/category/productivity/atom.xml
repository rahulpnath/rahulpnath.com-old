    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Keyboard Shortcuts" src="/images/keyboard_shortcuts.jpg" /></p>

<p>I prefer to use the keyboard to navigate within sites I use frequently. Keyboard enables to navigate faster within site and perform tasks quicker. The <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-six-months-and-counting-logitech-mx-master/">Logitech MX Master</a> mouse provides a lot of capabilities to navigate. But I find the keyboard faster to perform repetitive actions - like posting a new status update on social media sites, managing tasks in Jira, TFS online, GitHub, responding to emails, Todoist, etc. Finding keyboard shortcuts on these various sites can itself be a daunting task. One might need to google to get the shortcuts or find the relevant documentation on the site. Luckily most of the popular sites today display a pop-up modal with all the keyboard shortcuts for the site when pressing <strong>Shift + ?</strong>. Note that this might not work on all the sites out there. But for most of the common ones that I use l, I find it working.</p>

<p>So the next time you spend a lot of time on a website try hitting <strong>Shift + ?</strong> to look for supported keyboard shortcuts.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are the kind of person that likes to listen to some music while working, then this one is for you. Music is proven to have significant effects on improving focus while working. But it is also quite possible to get fully immersed in the music and forget all about work. Different kinds of music contribute to improving concentration while not getting immersed in the music itself. I usually <a href="http://theheadphonesrule.com/">wear my headphones</a> at work while working and listen to music.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Music helps to minimize distractions and helps you reach a state of <a href="http://amzn.to/2jlYIgV">Flow</a>, which is ideal for improving productivity.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>At times I like to hear to just some background noises simulating different environments. <a href="https://www.noisli.com/">Noisli</a> is an application that helps mix different sounds and create your perfect environment. The sounds could either be working in a restaurant or while it&rsquo;s raining with thunder, in a forest, by the side of the fire, etc. It helps create the mood that you want and helps recreate it with sound. Since the noises are of a fixed pattern, you soon get used to it and improves concentration at work.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Noisli - Favorite Combos" src="/images/noisli_favorite.png" /></p>

<p>Here are my favorite mixes in Noisli.
<a href="https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/W5rvjLZXcoJbooq">Rain Mix</a>, <a href="https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/vjUpcG2OAXxKVSU">Jungle</a>, <a href="https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/uhRXMysAIcVEbHF">TRain</a>, <a href="https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/gFKhnETdoybxcmc">HotelRainFire</a></p>

<p>You can use Noisli directly from the <a href="https://www.noisli.com/">website</a> or use any of their <a href="https://www.noisli.com/apps">Apps and Extensions</a>. Find out what works for you and leave a comment on your favorite combos.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/paste-without-formatting/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/paste-without-formatting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I share a lot of information copying and pasting from websites. Most of the times I want to share just the text and not any formatting. To remove any text formatting, I copy it into Notepad and then onto the destination. Yesterday I found that using <strong>Ctrl + Shift + V</strong> to paste (instead of <em>Ctrl + V</em>) removes all text formatting.</p>

<p>As shown, when using Ctrl + V the text gets copied along with the formatting as shown below.</p>

<p><img alt="Paste With Formatting" src="/images/paste_with_formatting.png" /></p>

<p>When using Ctrl + Shift + V, only the text gets copied and the formatting is ignored.
<img alt="Paste Without Formatting" src="/images/paste_without_formatting.png" /></p>

<p>Using this shortcut saves time as I no longer need to open Notepad for this!</p>

<p>PS: As one of my readers rightly pointed out (below in the comments), this might not work on all applications. I have tried this on Chrome Browser and Lync For Business and worked fine.</p>

    <updated>2016-11-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-in-the-learning-loop</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The current state of the IT industry demands one to be constantly on the go and learning something new. New technologies, frameworks, languages etc. are getting released almost every other day. It is easy to get overwhelmed with all this information. The best way to keep up is to ignore most of it. But every now and then you would want to learn something new either because of project demands or out of personal interests. It is important to have a learning plan for yourself and stick through with it when wanting to learn something. If not it&rsquo;s easy to get distracted. These are some of the ways how I try to structure my learning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/media/keeleuniversity/lpdc/images/LPDC-Banner-Blue.jpg">
<img  alt="Make writing a habit - write daily" src="/images/learning_continuosly.png"/>
</a></p>

<h4><strong>Choosing and Sticking to a Topic</strong></h4>

<p>The most important thing in learning something new is to decide on what to learn. This could either be driven by work needs or personal interests. It&rsquo;s easier when driven by work needs as you do not have much to choose on. But still, you need to make sure that you stay within the boundaries of what you are trying to learn. It&rsquo;s easy to get off track as there might be a lot of things that come up which you are not aware of. At times understanding things with a certain level of abstraction is important. Just like social networks distracting you off from real work, different terminologies can get you off on a different path. So make sure you always stick to your end goal.</p>

<h4><strong>Books, Blogs, Videos</strong></h4>

<p>There are different ways that you can learn something new. It could either be books, videos, podcasts, blogs etc. There is no such thing as the best mode to learn. Mode of learning is person specific. So don&rsquo;t try to just imitate what your friend does. Try to find what works for you the best. Whenever I am learning something new, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/language-agnostic-books-for-every-developer-2/">books</a> work the best. Books give a structured approach to a new topic and eases your way through the topic. Though I have a Kindle, for technical books I <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/ebook-or-hard-copy/">prefer hard copies</a>. Often I find the need to refer back or forward a few pages and it feels best on a physical book.  I find blogs useful for learning more about a topic that I already have some idea about. For getting an overview of topics and interesting things I find videos and podcasts useful. So depending upon the need I mix and match these different learning modes.</p>

<p><img alt="Current Reading List" src="/images/learning_books.jpg"/></p>

<h4><strong>Open Source Projects, Forums, Demo application</strong></h4>

<p>It is important that you try out whatever your learn. There are different ways that you can learn by doing and depends on the individual. When learning a new topic I choose to come up with a sample application to be built using the new technology that I am learning. I created <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/picfinity/9wzdncrdwxx8">Picfinity</a> when I was learning Window 8 Modern applications. Once comfortable with a topic I choose to either answer <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/stars-do-count/">questions on forums</a> (mostly <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/rahul%20p%20nath?type=forum&amp;referrer=http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=AzureKeyVault">msdn</a> or <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/2205373/rahul-p-nath">stack overflow</a>). Contributing to open source projects is also another approach to gets some hands-on experience. Contributing to open source projects also helps the community and improves your self-confidence. <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> is a good place to start with open source contribution.</p>

<h4><strong>Freelancing</strong></h4>

<p>Not always you get to implement what you learn at your work. Implementing in real world projects is an important aspect of learning. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-freelancing-jobs-online/">Freelancing</a> is a good way to get work in areas that you want to improve or learn. Bid for projects that uses technologies that you are learning. It might be hard to get offered projects on technologies that you have no prior experience with. Showcasing any sample applications that you have built while learning increases your chances of getting the job. I used Picfinity to show that I can build Windows 8 and phone applications. This landed me opportunities to build different windows phone and windows 8 application.</p>

<h4><strong>Blog</strong></h4>

<p>Sharing your learnings helps improve your own understanding of the topic. It also helps others taking your same path and learning the new topic. Each one of us has a different perspective of understanding and learning things. So don&rsquo;t worry if you are writing about something that is already been written about. Make sure you blog your learnings and if you are new to blogging then there is no better time to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/blogging/">get started</a>. Blogs act as a good resume when applying for a job.</p>

<p>With new technologies and frameworks coming up every other day it is hard to keep up with all of them. It is not necessary to understand everything that is out there. What is important is that you should be able to learn quickly when the need arises. Also keep yourself aware of the changes in the industry and technologies you use. It does not matter if you do not know all the latest technologies. What matters is how fast you can learn a new concept. Have a learning plan! What do you find the most effective way to learn?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Consistency is important in blogging. It does not matter if you are bad at writing, have nothing to write or nobody reads your blog. What matters is whether you write on a predictable schedule - once a month, once a week, once a year, one per day etc. If you do not have a schedule you are more likely to fall off from sticking to blogging. I had <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/own-your-urls/">written before</a>, I always struggled to write regularly. But since the start of this year, I have been blogging to a schedule (once a week) and have been successful with that. This post looks into some of the challenges that I faced and things that I have incorporated to stick to a schedule.</p>

</a></p>

<h3>Make Writing a Habit</h3>

<p>Writing posts was hard and I always procrastinated on it. It often took me more than a week to complete a post. There&rsquo;s a saying, <strong><em>If it hurts, do it more often</em></strong> - So to make writing easy I had to write more often.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>I write only when inspiration strikes. Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o&#8217;clock sharp.</em></p>

<p><em>- <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/302963-i-write-only-when-inspiration-strikes-fortunately-it-strikes-every">Somerset Maugham</a></em></p></blockquote>

<h4><strong>Generating Topics</strong></h4>

<p>Till a year back I struggled to find topics to blog. I did not find any &lsquo;cool thing&rsquo; that was worth blogging. Not much has changed even now on doing &lsquo;cool things&rsquo;. The only thing that changed was that I decided to write every day - no matter what I do or don&rsquo;t do.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>I have always struggled to find topics to blog, but then I realized all I need is to pay attention to things that I do daily</em></p></blockquote>

<p>A year back I asked <a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/about-simple-programmer/">John Somnez from SimpleProgrammer</a> the same question.</p>

<p><img  alt="email to John Somnez (SimpleProgrammer) on finding a blogging schedule" src="/images/bloggingSchedule_john_email.png"/></p>

<p>Though I did not get a reply from John, it kept me thinking. Late last year I started a Daily challenge of &lsquo;<em>Generating at least one blog topic a day</em>&rsquo; for a month. I did not have to write anything, just find a topic to blog and add it to a OneNote list. I did this for a month and found that I had enough topics to write on. Since the challenge did not have anything to do with writing, I did not restrict my thoughts. This is when I realized that it is not the lack of topics that I don&rsquo;t blog, but the fear of writing. That&rsquo;s when I started the &lsquo;Write Everyday&rsquo; daily challenge.</p>

<h4><strong>Write Everyday</strong></h4>

<p>This is one of the most important things that I found to be able to write posts regularly - <strong>Write Everyday</strong>. Yes every day, no matter what happens, I write at least one line towards a post. Since the goal is to <em>Write just one line for a blog post</em>, I hardly miss this goal. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Keeping the goal small and simple</a> is a trick that I picked from the book Mini Habits and find it useful. You can follow this for anything that you want to make a habit.</p>

<h4><strong>Make it Visible</strong></h4>

<p>Seeing something progressing to completion helps me to get it done faster. I used to write elsewhere and then copy it to my blog and publish it. This did not give me a sense of progression. I now have a <a href="/blog/optimizing-octopress-workflow-for-new-posts/">draft post workflow</a>, integrated with my blogging platform. I can preview this blog along with the draft posts on my laptop. This helps give a sense of progression and also makes the end goal visible.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Making your goal clear and visible helps you achieve it faster</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I also use this to keep track of new post ideas. Whenever I find a topic to blog, I add it as a draft. I add bullet points to the post whenever I get more thoughts on that topic. Once there are enough points to write about, I work on that post.</p>

<h3>Make Blogging All About Writing</h3>

<p>The last thing that I want is to get stuck with mundane repetitive tasks of publishing a post to get in the way of writing. The more regular I became in writing, I started noticing a lot of repetitive tasks in my blogging workflow. When you do any activity repetitively you notice tasks that you do over and over again. I started modifying my blog engine for my needs and to reduce manual effort.</p>

<h4><strong>Write in Advance</strong></h4>

<p>Having posts ready to be published is helpful as it gives the flexibility to slack a bit when in need. It&rsquo;s a great feeling to have blog posts ready to be published (right now I have posts ready for a month). I modified my blogging engine to support <a href="/blog/automatic_deployment_of_future_posts_with_octopress">publishing posts on future dates</a>. This helps me set publishing dates in the future for posts and it gets automatically deployed on the day. Automating the publishing helped make blogging more about writing. I can forget about it as soon as I complete a post by specifying the date I want it to be published and be rest assured that it will get published.</p>

<h4><strong>Make Writing Accessible</strong></h4>

<p>You never know when you have that free time and want to blog. Maybe it&rsquo;s while traveling, or waiting in a queue or at your work desk. You might be <a href="/blog/staying-productive-offline">offline or connected</a> Making it possible to write from irrespective of the kind of device (laptop, mobile, tablet) and connectivity was key for me. I have my draft posts synchronized through Dropbox and available on all my devices. This helps use all the pockets of time that I get for myself.</p>

<p>These are the things that have helped me pick a schedule and follow it. I have been successful in publishing one post per week for the past 10 months and want to keep at it going forward. Now that I am able to publish regularly, I want to improve the speed at which I write posts. Though I reduced the time from over a week to days, I still find this too long and want to reduce it to a day. Modifying the way images are added, optimized and served is also something that I am trying to optimize currently. Do you <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/own-your-urls/">have a blog</a>? If not start one and stick to a schedule that works for you!</p>
