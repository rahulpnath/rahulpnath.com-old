    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s about three months since I started running. I just completed my first half marathon and thought of putting together on how I have been going on with my running. I had a lot of questions myself when I started running, so hope this helps someone else taking the same journey.</p>

</div>


<h3>Tracking</h3>

<p>I started running using the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runtastic.android&amp;hl=en">Runtastic</a> application on my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/">android phone</a>. The free version app offers most of the required features to start running. I upgraded to their <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/premium-membership">Premium version</a> primarily for <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/results">Runtastic Results</a>(more on it below).</p>

<p>Once I got regular with my runs I wanted better tracking, mainly to monitor heart rate. I was unsure of what a heart rate monitor would provide and if at all there is any value in getting one. I reached out to my runner friends, and all of them had one. Most of them had a Garmin, and a few had Fitbit. Until then I was planning to get the <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/au/charge2">Fitbit Charge 2</a> which comes with <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/whats-inside-fitness-tracker-anyway/#ixzz4cBARwI9q">optical heart rate monitoring</a>. It primarily uses an optical sensor and senses the heart rate from the wrist. The Garmin&rsquo;s make watches that are more <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-AU/AU/cIntoSports-cRunning-p1.html">specific for runners</a>, and since the majority of my friends owned Garmin, I decided on to get one of the Garmin Forerunner series.</p>

<p>One of the shops near to where I live was running a promotional offer on the <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-AU/AU/p/516105">Garmin Forerunner 630 Bundle</a>. But this model comes with a <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-AU/AU/p/530376">Heart Rate Monitor (HRM) Strap</a>. The strap needs to be worn around the chest during the run. Strap v Optical HRM added a new dimension of confusion to the whole tracker story. I reached out to my <a href="https://twitter.com/rahulpnath/status/835320810734694400">runner friends again</a> and surprisingly all of them had models of Garmin that uses an HRM Strap.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wareable.com/garmin/garmin-forerunner-630-review">
<img alt="Garmin Forerunner 630 Bundle" class="center" src="/images/running_forerunner630.jpg" />
</a></p>

<p>The Garmin Forerunner 630 is a GPS SmartWatch with Advanced Running Metrics. It provides all the data a runner needs (and a lot more than what I need). Paired with HRM monitor it helps measure cadence, vertical oscillation and additional running dynamics like ground contact time balance, stride length and vertical ratio. I still don&rsquo;t understand all the data that it shows but find the GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring and zones, training plans and custom workouts a great help to my runs. Garmin also integrates well with <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/rahulpnath">Strava</a> where most of my other friends are there. The watch has a companion app on the phone and also a <a href="http://connect.garmin.com">website</a> which helps visualize the data.</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/results">Runtastic Results</a> provides a 12-week bodyweight training plan with the <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/premium-membership">premium subscription</a>. I am on week five of the training. It took a while for me to get started but now I try not to miss it. The free version of the app has all exercises available as stand-alone exercises. You can use these if you don&rsquo;t want to get the premium subscription.</p>

<p><img alt="Runtastic Results" class="center" src="/images/running_runtastic_results.png" /></p>

<p>I am following a diet to lose weight, and I weigh now 78 (±1) kilos and has been on that for around one month. I was around 95 when I started out with the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/">running and diet</a>.</p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>During the first few weeks of running, I was mostly doing free runs and trying to cover the maximum distance possible. The tracked information was useful in isolation to a specific run, and I did not do anything to improve. I then started on a beginner training plan with Runtastic
to <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/users/4b76cfab-734e-1658-b5e4-600759a3b066/training-plans/747577">Run 50 min after 6 weeks</a>. This put me into the mode to compare my runs with the previous and work to improve on them. Now and then I wanted to stop the plan and continue with my normal run as I felt the plan wasn&rsquo;t working. But I decided to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/psm-learnings/">stick to the process</a> until the end. On completion of the training, I was able to run continuously for fifty minutes, and that was a measurable improvement for me.</p>

<p><img alt="Runtastic Training Plan Certificate" src="/images/running_runtastic_certificate.png" /></p>

<p>My friend and colleague <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/12340841">Tony</a> is an avid runner. To improve on the pace, he advised starting shorter interval training. To improve pace, fix the pace to what you want to achieve and run for a specified interval (time or distance). Garmin enables you to create a custom workout setting various parameters on the run. The custom workout helps to keep up with your goals during the run.</p>

<p><img alt="Garmin Custom Workout" class="center" src="/images/running_garmin_workout.jpg" /></p>

<p>Running at a constant pace is important to help cover longer distances. Initially, I used to run with all my energy. So my pace often spiked and then fell and then spiked again. If you are training to improve your speed, it&rsquo;s hard to tell whether there is an improvement in speed unless you run at a constant (little variation) in speed. Check out the graph that plots your pace to check the pace variations. Most running applications show this information.</p>

<h3>Breathing</h3>

<p>Proper breathing is one the key things with running. I did not give much importance to breathing at first. I found it very hard to run long distances without stopping in between by following a random breathing pattern. There are different suggestions on breathing style. I found the article <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/running-on-air-breathing-technique">Running On Air: Breathing Technique</a> helpful and try to follow the pattern mentioned there (quoted below).</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The singular point of all rhythmic breathing patterns is this: Exhale on alternate footstrikes as you run. You never want to continually exhale on the same foot. The rhythmic breathing patterns I recommend call for a longer inhale than exhale. Why the longer inhale? Your diaphragm and other breathing muscles contract during inhalation, which brings stability to your core. These same muscles relax during exhalation, decreasing stability. With the goal of injury prevention in mind, it&rsquo;s best to hit the ground more often when your body is at its most stable—during inhalation. Let&rsquo;s start with a 5-count or 3:2 pattern of rhythmic breathing, which will apply to most of your running. Inhale for three steps and exhale for two.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I particularly liked the reference to yoga and meditation in the article. It gave the realization that running is a form of meditation. Establishing a breathing rhythm helped me run longer distances comfortably and without losing breath. If you want to get a deeper understanding of breath and how it affects our life I recommend reading the book <a href="http://amzn.to/2nkIlUQ">Science Of Breath</a>.</p>

<p>I ran my first <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/users/4b76cfab-734e-1658-b5e4-600759a3b066/sport-sessions/58d587fdd03a4c443e6d656c">Half Marathon</a> on 25th of March. I did at a casual pace to understand what it takes to run one. I tried to keep my pace between 6:15 - 6:30 min/km and was able to finish it at 6:19 min/km. It took me 2:13:11 hours and I am glad that I did not stop even once. It was more a mental game to stay at it than anything physical, and I am happy that I could finish it successfully! Hope this helps someone else as well starting off with running. Sound off in the comments if this helps you or some tips if you are already a runner!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/improved-code-navigation-in-visual-studio-2017/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/improved-code-navigation-in-visual-studio-2017</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Visual Studio (VS) 2017 improves a lot on Code Navigation features.  If at all anything ever attracted me to ReSharper it was code navigation (though I have not been using it for a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">couple of years now</a>). Visual Studio lacked behind in this aspect but not anymore. The new features help improve developer productivity and here are few I found worth looking.</p>

<p>In earlier versions, the navigation features are all over the menu. In VS2017 all the navigation features are available under <strong><em>Edit -> Go To</em></strong>. Though I usually prefer using the keyboard shortcut for opening the navigate dialogs, it&rsquo;s good to have all under the same menu.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Visual Studio 2017 Code Navigation" src="/images/visualstudio_code_navigation.png" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Control + T</em></strong> brings up the Go To Dialog box which now has a lot more icons and options compared to the previous VS versions. Typing in &lsquo;<em>?</em>&rsquo; lists the different filtering criteria available when querying. It also allows searching across all the criteria by just not specifying the filtering criteria. To search for a file, type in &lsquo;<em>f FileName</em>&rsquo;. These filters also have direct shortcuts as shown in the image above.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Visual Studio 2017 Go To Shortcuts" src="/images/visualstudio_goto.png" /></p>

<p>CamelCase search is the one that attracts me the most. By entering just the capital letters of the name it quickly filters out the particular class. As shown below by just typing <em>CSG</em> it brings up the class <strong>C</strong>har<strong>S</strong>equence<strong>G</strong>enerator. Typing in the full class name is no longer required and makes navigation faster.</p>

<p><img  class="center" alt="Visual Studio 2017 Go To Camel Case Matching" src="/images/visualstudio_camelcasematching.png" /></p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6NVTASKa1A">video</a> to see these features and more in action. Hope it helps!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Rescue Time - My dashboard for March,2017" src="/images/rescuetime.png" /></p>

<p>Tracking is essential for measuring progress. Depending on your area of focus tracking tools differ. If it is a time-based activity that you are tracking a simple watch can suffice the need. But this can soon become an overhead. <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">Rescue Time</a> helps track time spent on a computer or mobile devices.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Rescue Time is a  personal analytics service that shows you how you spend your time and provides tools to help you be more productive.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Rescue time runs in the background and helps you track the applications and websites that you use. Most of the applications are categorized automatically; However, it also allows manual categorization. Rescue Time lets you edit an activity and assign it to various categories and set productivity levels. So if you are spending more time on an application configured as <em>very productive</em> then your overall productivity pulse is higher for the day.</p>

<p><img alt="Rescue Time - Edit Activity" src="/images/rescuetime_edit_activity.png" /></p>

<p>Once you have your time tracked you can then adapt yourself to be more productive. Various reports are provided to visualize the data collected. The <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/rescuetime-pro">premium version</a> offers a lot more features to help improve productivity. I am currently on the Free Plan. Rescue Time helps inspect your current behaviors and patterns at work. Once you have the details, you can understand where your time is spent and improve on it as required. Rescue Time is available for <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/get_rescuetime">computer and mobile devices</a>. Hope this helps track your time and become more productive!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/tomighty-a-pomodoro-timer/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/tomighty-a-pomodoro-timer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://tomighty.org/"><img alt="Tomighty, Pomodoro Timer" src="/images/tomighty.png" /></a></p>

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, I have been trying to improve my focus while working. With <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/">running (3 * 1.5 hours a week) and bodyweight training (3 * 30 minutes a week)</a> taking a significant part of my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">morning routine</a>, I have less time for <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/2016-recap/">blogging, learning, and videos</a>. Though I have known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">The Pomodoro Technique</a> for a long time, I never practiced it regularly. With less time and more things to get done, I badly had to do something to get back on track with everything and thought of giving it a try.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named Pomodoro</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Initially, I was looking at apps that can integrate with <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/todoist-manage-your-todo-list/">Todoist</a>, my task management tool. There are a lot of <a href="https://support.todoist.com/hc/en-us/articles/210762349-Pomodoro-with-Todoist">pomodoro apps that integrate with Todoist</a>, but I found all of them an overkill.
<a href="http://tomighty.org/"><strong>Tomighty</strong></a> is a simple Pomodoro timer that just tracks time and settings for the Pomodoro interval and long and short breaks. It hides away well in the Notification area of the taskbar and shows the amount of time left in the current interval. It plays sounds when an interval starts and ends. You can interrupt a Pomodoro session and restart it if required. That is all that you need from a timer to keep up with the Pomodoro technique.</p>

<p><em>If you are on a high DPI machine running Windows, the UI might not scale well. There is a <a href="https://github.com/tomighty/tomighty/issues/115">workaround</a> for this.</em></p>

<p>Sticking to the Pomodoro Technique has been working well for me, and I am able to focus better on the task at hand. I am still exploring the technique and trying to improve on it. Do you use Pomodoro Technique? If you are new to Pomodoro Technique and want to learn more check out the book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2nCSZW1">The Pomodoro Technique</a>, by Francesco Cirillo, the creator of the technique.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/track-current-file-in-visual-studio-solution-explorer/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/track-current-file-in-visual-studio-solution-explorer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While working on large codebases, I want my Solution Explorer to be synchronized with the current working file. With the solution explorer in sync, it makes navigating to other related files, adding new classes in the same location, renaming files, etc. faster.</p>

<p><img alt="Track Active Item in Solution Explorer, Visual Studio" src="/images/visualstudio_trackActiveItem.png" /></p>

<p>The setting to keep the items in sync is configurable in Visual Studio and is turned off by default. You can enable this by checking the &lsquo;<strong><em>Track Active Item in Solution Explorer</em></strong>&rsquo; under <em>Options -> Projects and Solutions -> General</em>. You can navigate there quickly using <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/quick-launch-in-visual-studio/">Visual Studio Quick Launch (Ctrl + Q)</a>. Just type &lsquo;<em>Track active</em>&rsquo; and you will get the quick link to the setting. Keep it checked, and off you go, the solution explorer and the current file will be in sync.</p>

<p>PS: Visual Studio 2017 is now available.<a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/">Get it</a> if you have not already!</p>
