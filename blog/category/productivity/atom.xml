<p><a href="https://blog.todoist.com/2015/11/19/new-way-to-create-todoist-templates/">Todoist Templates</a> is a simple way to create tasks for any of your recurring activities. Be it blogging, cooking, or any of your activities. With Todoist Templates, you can turn any project into a checklist that you can easily duplicate later. I have been using <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/todoist-manage-your-todo-list/">Todoist</a> for a long time and find it useful to keep track of tasks (both personal and at work)</p>

<h4><strong>Problem</strong></h4>

<p>I <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/experimenting-with-pomodoro-technique/">plan my tasks</a> for the upcoming week on Sunday morning. I pull in tasks for the upcoming week, and some of these tasks are template based. For e.g. for writing a blog post, I have the below template</p>

<pre><code class="text">TYPE,CONTENT,PRIORITY,INDENT,AUTHOR,RESPONSIBLE,DATE,DATE_LANG,TIMEZONE
task,Blog: BlogTopic,4,1,Rahul (3565260),,,en,Australia/Melbourne
task,BlogTopic: Draft Body,4,2,Rahul (3565260),,today,en,Australia/Melbourne
task,BlogTopic: Refine Body,4,2,Rahul (3565260),,today,en,Australia/Melbourne
task,BlogTopic: Intro and Conclusion,4,2,Rahul (3565260),,tomorrow,en,Australia/Melbourne
task,"BlogTopic: Images, Proof Read and Publish",4,2,Rahul (3565260),,tomorrow,en,Australia/Melbourne
</code></pre>

<p>The dates on the template are relative to the day that you import the template in Todoist. So if I pull in the template on a Sunday, the tasks will start on Sunday. This is not something that I want; I want them to start on a Monday. Alternatively, I can update the template to start from tomorrow. Even in that case, I will always have to know the exact start day relative to the day that I intend to pull in. I usually plan for the tasks on a Sunday but still, like the flexibility to pull in tasks any day of the week.</p>

<h3>Todoist Template Transformer</h3>

<p>The Todoist Template Transformer takes in a date and template path and adjusts all tasks in the template to start relative to the passed in date. In the above example, if I want to blog on Wednesday, I will input the Wednesday date and the template file path. The first two tasks will start on Wednesday and the third and fourth on Thursday. Running the transformer on a Sunday (07-May-2017) with the next Wednesday (10-May-2017) below is the new template</p>

<pre><code class="bat">TodoistTemplateTransformer.exe -startDate "10-May-2017" -templateFile "Blog Template.csv"
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">TYPE,CONTENT,PRIORITY,INDENT,AUTHOR,RESPONSIBLE,DATE,DATE_LANG,TIMEZONE
task,Blog: BlogTopic,4,1,Rahul (3565260),,,en,Australia/Melbourne
task,BlogTopic: Draft Body,4,2,Rahul (3565260),,in 3 days,en,Australia/Melbourne
task,BlogTopic: Refine Body,4,2,Rahul (3565260),,in 3 days,en,Australia/Melbourne
task,BlogTopic: Intro and Conclusion,4,2,Rahul (3565260),,in 4 days,en,Australia/Melbourne
task,"BlogTopic: Images, Proof Read and Publish",4,2,Rahul (3565260),,in 4 days,en,Australia/Melbourne
</code></pre>

<p>This utility is written in FSharp the <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/todoisttemplatetransformer">source code is available here</a> if you are interested. I am still in the initial stages of learning FSharp, so if you have any suggestions to improve the code, please raise a Pull Request or drop in a comment.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/visual-studio-task-list-keep-track-of-your-todo-comments/"/>
    <updated>2017-05-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/visual-studio-task-list-keep-track-of-your-todo-comments</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It often happens when coding that I skip over some part and want to come back to it at a later point in time. I leave some comments in the code so that I do not miss it. It can be a bit tricky to keep track of these comments themselves. Before pushing up the changes to <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell">master branch</a> or creating a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">Pull Request</a>, I make sure that all such comments are addressed.</p>

<p>Visual Studio comes with a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/txtwdysk(v=vs.120).aspx">Task List</a> that is handy to track such unfinished work in code. It helps track your pending work items in one place and easily navigate to it. To have a comment appear in the task list, it has to start with a defined token (TODO, HACK, UNDONE, etc.) followed by the comment.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">public bool IsInRange(DateTime theDateTime)
{
    //TODO: Implement this function
    throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/taskList.png" class="center" alt="Visual Studio Task List" /></p>

<blockquote><p><em>A comment in your code preceded by a comment marker and a predefined token will appear in the Task List window. For example, the above comment has three distinct parts:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>The comment marker (//)</em></li>
<li><em>The token (TODO)</em></li>
<li><em>The comment (the rest of the text)</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Visual Studio by default has TODO, HACK and UNDONE as tokens. You can modify this under Options -> Task List. New custom tokens can be added as required and used instead of the default ones.</p>

<p><img src="/images/taskList_customize.png" class="center" alt="Visual Studio, Customize Task List" /></p>

<p>When in a multi-member team you can either use custom tokens per member or append the comment with your name or feature name. The Task List provides Search feature with which you can filter the tasks created by you or for the feature you are working.</p>

<p>I try to remove all TODO comments before merging to the master branch. For tasks that need to be tracked even after a merge, I create separate work items to the project backlog (VSTS, GitHub Tasks, Jira whatever the team is using). I might still leave the TODO comment with the relevant ticket details as well for tracking.</p>

<p>The next time you leave some unfinished work for later make sure you have it tracked. Hope it helps!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/flux-make-it-easy-for-your-eyes/"/>
    <updated>2017-04-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/flux-make-it-easy-for-your-eyes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you spent a lot of time in front of a computer then <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">f.lux</a> is for you. You would have heard that using laptop or mobile just before sleep is bad. It is because of the <a href="http://www.bluelightexposed.com/">blue light</a> that digital screens emit.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>During the day, computer screens look goodâ€”they&rsquo;re designed to look like the sun. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be looking at the sun.</em></p>

<p><em>f.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer&rsquo;s display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" alt="Flux Current Setting" src="/images//flux_current.png" /></p>

<p><em>Tell f.lux what kind of lighting you have, and where you live. Then forget about it. f.lux will do the rest, automatically.</em> <br/>
f.lux adjusts the screen to the room you are in and the time of the day. You can set the lighting that the room has, and it will adjust the screen for it.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Flux Settings" src="/images//flux_settings.png" /></p>

<p>I have been using f.lux for a couple of years and had it always on(except occasionally when <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/photography-learning-to-click/">processing photos</a>). <a href="https://fluxometer.com/">f.luxometer</a> tells how much blue light f.lux removes if you are interested.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/experimenting-with-pomodoro-technique/"/>
    <updated>2017-04-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/experimenting-with-pomodoro-technique</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back I had blogged about my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Morning Routine</a>. The routine helps set the pace for the day and in getting things done that matters to me most. During mid of December 2016, I started running once a week to get some exercise into my routine. I got interested in running and soon was running thrice a week along with some free body exercises another three days. Since this was new and exciting naturally my concentration was more on getting these done. I struggled to keep up with my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/maintaining-a-blogging-schedule/">blogging schedule</a>, failed to get a video out in the month of February and lost track of <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/2016-recap/">everything else</a> (FSharp, Reading, etc.). Though I continued to wake up <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/waking-up-early-is-all-about-waking-up-to-an-alarm/">early in the morning</a>, I could not get much done. I badly wanted to fix things up and here is what I have come up with</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>One-week sprints and setting weekly goals</li>
<li>Break the Big Rocks (or MIT&rsquo;s) into smaller tasks</li>
<li>Improve Focus using Pomodoro Technique</li>
<li>Daily Review and Weekly Review</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>One Week Sprints</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/psm-learnings/">PSM course</a> I attended in January made me realize the importance is sticking to a process. I decided to do weekly sprints for managing my personal work. I have a better estimate of how much I can get done with a shorter interval. I have blocked time on Sunday morning for my weekly planning and processing the &lsquo;In-Basket.&rsquo; The In-Basket is where anything that comes up during the week goes. Todoist has an Inbox Project to which any uncategorized items go by default. I process the inbox and move them to various categories that I have setup in Todoist. Depending on the priority things make their way into the coming week or get set to &lsquo;tentative&rsquo; dates and appropriate categories.</p>

<p><img alt = "Todoist Inbox" src="/images/pomodoro_todoist_inbox.png" /></p>

<p><em>Big Rocks</em> are tasks that matter to you the most. Identifying them is important so that you do not miss out on them. The idea is to fill your time available over the week with the Big Rocks. The rest will find its way through, just like if you were to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VNmIxkyHd8">fill a bottle with stones first and then fill it with water, sand as opposed to the other way round</a>. Big Rocks are the same as the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Most Important Tasks (MIT&rsquo;s)</a> that we saw earlier.</p>

<p>For me the biggest rock is family, and I have all of my evenings and weekends (rather any time they are awake, and I am home) blocked out for them. Over the past year, since I have written about my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Morning Routine</a> one of the MIT&rsquo;s has changed. Blogging and FSharp still stay on, but I swapped in producing videos for Github contribution. Exercise is something I have set as a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/2016-recap/">goal for 2017</a>. To keep up with my exercise goal, I <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/">run three times a week and body weight exercises for another three days</a>.</p>

<p>Every day I have roughly three hours of &lsquo;me time&rsquo; from morning 4 am - 7 am. Waking up was difficult for a while but then I realized it&rsquo;s all about <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/waking-up-early-is-all-about-waking-up-to-an-alarm/">waking up to an alarm</a>. The &lsquo;me time&rsquo; acts as the bottle into which I have to fit the Big Rocks into (if you watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VNmIxkyHd8">video above</a>). I need to optimize the things in the best way possible to fit it all in there.</p>

<h3>Pomodoro Sized Tasks</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">The Pomodoro Technique</a> is a time management technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named Pomodoro.</p>

<p>Many times in the past I have tried Pomodoro Technique on and off but was never able to stick with it. From my previous <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Morning Routine</a> you can easily tell that I had a high-level plan on what my MIT&rsquo;s are, but did not have any specific plans or goals on what to do about them. I also left room for flexibility to choose each day to pick up things randomly. Often it happened that I took more time to blog and got a bit of time for the other MIT&rsquo;s. Though I have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YTjHWjepag">automated a lot of blogging activities</a>, writing a post often took more time. And since I was not tracking this I was always happy that I achieved some of my MIT&rsquo;s daily.</p>

<p>Once I started running things changed drastically. I struggled to keep up the with everything and concentrated on just blogging. It was because I started losing focus and started getting the feeling that it&rsquo;s too hard to fit in everything. I let this happen for over a month but was not very happy with it. Mid of February I sat down and dumped all my available time onto a paper and broke them up into Pomodoro sized intervals. So now I know how much time I have in a week for getting stuff done. I then broke down my big rocks s into smaller measurable pieces. For, e.g., with blogging, I have 4 Pomodoro of work - Creating a draft (high level), Refining the post body, Writing the introduction and conclusion and finally Adding in images, proofreading, and publishing. Similarly, I broke down publishing videos (happens throughout a month) and learning F#.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Plans are nothing; Planning is everything</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I blocked out the time for running and exercise first, then I filled in with blogging tasks, followed by videos and then with FSharp learning. I also have a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/8539430">reading goal for 2017</a> and found that I can best do that during my commute to work. Though this is not a full sized pomodoro interval, I have this tracked. Weekly Planning and Daily Review are two other activities that I have started following religiously. I do my daily planning right after my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/psm-learnings/">Daily Scrum</a> at work so that I get to capture anything work related as well.</p>

<p><img alt = "Pomodoro Plan" src="/images/pomodoro_plan.png" /></p>

<p>I was surprised how easily I could fit all of these into the time I have. Since the task breakdown above is guesstimates, I have some buffer time in my plan so that I can accommodate tasks that take more time or urgent tasks that come up during the week or the laziness that kicks in at times.</p>

<h3>Increasing Focus and Removing Distractions</h3>

<p>Social Media and emails were one of the biggest distractions for me. Even though I try to reduce the amount of time I spent for these, I often ended up taking a glance at those sites now and then. It often ended distracting and taking me completely off course from the task. I decided to stick to checking personal email only once a day and work emails twice a day. As for social networks (especially Facebook), I decided to keep that to one as well. I wanted to track this as well and see how well I was with it. I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&amp;hl=en">Loop Habit Tracker</a> app on my phone for tracking these habits.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Loop Habit Tracker" src="/images/pomodoro_habit_tracker.png" /></p>

<p>For tracking pomodoro I use <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tomighty-a-pomodoro-timer/">Tomighty, a simple Pomodoro tool</a>. It just tracks the interval and does that thing well. The Pomodoro Technique lists down different techniques to manage interruptions and distractions. Managing interruptions is particularly useful when working out of an office and using pomodoro. During the short intervals, I usually take a walk around, fill water, stretch, etc.</p>

<p>I have only been following this for three weeks. But I find this effective and hope to stick on with it for a longer time. I no longer have to spend time deciding what to do as that&rsquo;s already decided. The only thing is to do it. Having taken the reasoning part of what to do out, I find doing things is easy and I procrastinate less.  The important thing is sticking with the process and believing in it. I am sure this is going to pass as well, but for now I happy and it works for me. How do you keep yourself productive? Sound off in the comments</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/buffer-smarter-social-sharing/"/>
    <updated>2017-04-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/buffer-smarter-social-sharing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Posts on this blog are published automatically on preset dates. I have created a custom workflow for this in Octopress, my blogging framework. If you are interested in the end to end workflow check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YTjHWjepag">video on it</a>. Publishing to different social media was also one of the things that I wanted to automate in the whole workflow. So whenever a post is published to my blog, it also posts to the different social media (Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn).</p>

<p><a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> is a tool to manage all your social media networks and publish content to it at one. It is a &lsquo;<em>Write Once, Publish Everywhere</em>&rsquo; kind of service and works best for me. From the Buffer website or using <a href="https://buffer.com/extensions">browser extensions</a> posts can be manually buffered. A buffered post can be published immediately, scheduled to be shared next or scheduled for a particular date and time. You can have custom messages for each of the social network that you are sharing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/buffer_share.png" alt="Buffer Share" class="center" /></p>

<p>For automatic updates from my blog, I use <a href="https://buffer.com/guides/email">Buffer via Email</a>. With every buffer account, there is an associated email address. A post can be buffered by sending an email to this address in a specific format. So every time a new blog is published I send an email to my buffer account to publish immediately (@postnow). Automatic sharing posts also helps me reduce the time I spend on social networks; <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/life-learnings-after-being-a-parent/">learning to disconnect</a></p>

<p>I am on their <a href="https://buffer.com/pricing">Free plan</a> at present. I have only less than ten posts scheduled at any point in time, and the plan provides all the features I need.</p>

<p>Hope this helps you manage your social media content.</p>
