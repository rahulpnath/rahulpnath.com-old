    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to everyone who attended <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Events/64/">my very first public talk</a>, at the <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/">C#Corner</a> <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Chapters/6/hyderabad-chapter.aspx">Hyderabad Chapter User Group(UG)</a> on February 1, Saturday on Windows Phone Development. Summary of the event is available <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/subhendude/C-Sharp-corner-hyderabad-user-group-meet-1-february-2014-offici/">here</a>. It was a very good experience speaking for the first time in front of a large audience, and from my side felt it went well. Here&rsquo;s some follow up information on the talk and also the code samples and presentations used.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There might be a lot of you who would be planning to get started with phone development or yet in the dilema of whether or not to - <em><strong>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think much and just start <a href="http://developer.windowsphone.com/en-us">getting your hands dirty</a></strong></em>&rsquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>If your current project/work does not demand you to use whatever we have got started with it, develop a simple application on your free time/weekends. You would get lot of app ideas at <a href="http://www.dvlup.com/SignIn">DVLUP</a> and may even get rewarded if you crack some of their challenges - <em><strong>Stay motivated.</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p>Make sure whatever you develop is always properly backed up and stored - <em><strong>Use a source control</strong></em>.
<a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-online-overview-vs#SKUDetailList_1">Visual Studio Online</a> or <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> are great free services that could get you started with.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn more about <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/tag/mvvm/">MVVM</a>.The mvvm toolkit that we were using at the demo is <a href="http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/">MVVM Light</a>. There are a couple of videos in <a href="http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/">there</a> that will help you get started with it. <a href="http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/">Prism</a> is also another alternative that we had talked about. - <em><strong>Reuse across platforms</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p>As we had discussed, Getting Started in Windows Phone Development means you have acquired the same skills to Get Started on Windows 8 application too - <em><strong>Get started <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/apps/br211386.aspx">here</a></strong></em>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are a lot of applications that are waiting to be developed for Windows phone and Windows 8 for which people are even ready to pay you. So if you want to earn out of your side projects, then try looking for projects in freelancing communities - <a href="https://www.odesk.com/">ODesk</a>, <a href="http://www.freelancer.in/">Freelancer</a>, <a href="https://www.elance.com/">Elance</a> are some to get you started - <em><strong>Earn while you Learn</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Feel free to get in touch in case you need any help while on your Windows phone journey.</p>
