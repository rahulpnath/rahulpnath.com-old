    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to mobile phones, I used to be a gadget freak and buy the latest phone as soon as it arrives in the market. But not after I got the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/">Nexus 5</a>. It&rsquo;s been well over three years now and not even once did I want to switch over to something else. The phone never slowed down over these years, and the battery lasted enough for the day. I broke the Nexus screen a couple of months back and was forced to switch over to a new phone. I didn&rsquo;t have to do much market research or phone comparisons this time; as I just knew which one to pick up.</p>

<p><a href="https://madeby.google.com/intl/en_au/phone/">The Pixel, Phone By Google!</a></p>

<p><img src="/images/pixel.png" alt="Pixel" class="center" /></p>

<h4><strong>Key Features</strong></h4>

<p>The Pixel is the first phone in the Google Pixel hardware line and is a successor to the Nexus range of devices. The Pixel runs <a href="https://www.android.com/intl/en_au/versions/nougat-7-0/">Android-Nougat</a> with some features exclusive to it. The Pixel is very much comparable to the Nexus, with improved hardware and latest software. Below are some of the key features that I like about the phone.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fingerprint sensor</strong> The fingerprint sensor on the back allows you to unlock the phone and specific apps and also authorize purchases. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/password-manager-get-one-if-you-havent-already/">1Password</a> is integrated with the sensor which enables me to unlock it using the sensor. I no longer need to type in my long master password every time I use 1Password.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Camera</strong> <em>Pixel takes brilliant photos in bright light, low light, and any light.</em> The camera is awesome and at times is a good replacement for your <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/photography-learning-to-click/">DSLR</a>. With Pixel, Google also provides unlimited original quality storage for all photos and videos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google Assistant</strong> Pixel is the first phone with the <a href="https://assistant.google.com/">Google Assistant</a> built-in. It helps you manage tasks, find content on phone and the internet, perform actions, etc. just like Siri or Cortana. I have not used the assistant much and yet to find some valid use cases.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4><strong>Apps</strong></h4>

<p> Some of the apps that I use regularly are</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/todoist-manage-your-todo-list/">Todoist</a>: My ToDo List</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/feedly-one-stop-reading-place/">Feedly</a>: For all my RSS feeds</li>

<li>Youtube: Videos</li>
</ul>


<h4><strong>Case </strong></h4>

<p>I am using the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/spigen-awesome-phone-cases/">Spigen Neo Hybrid</a> case for Pixel. It adds extra weight to the phone, but I am used to it from my Nexus as well. The Neo Hybrid provides military grade protection and protects the phone from most falls.</p>

<p>Overall I have found the Pixel a good phone and recommend it to anyone looking out for a new phone now. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is also of the same range (slightly costlier) and worth considering if you are not too particular about having a vanilla Android experience. Which phone do you use?</p>

    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/spigen-awesome-phone-cases</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are looking to get a case for your phone, then check out cases by <a href="https://www.spigen.com/">Spigen</a>. I have been using Spigen cases for over three years, and I totally recommend it.</p>

<p>Spigen cases are made with premium materials and are slim, sleek and simple. Spigen provides various models that match different needs. The cases provide <a href="https://www.spigen.com/pages/military-grade">Military Grade Protection</a> and protect the phone from most falls.</p>

<p>The first Spigen cases I got was for my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/">Nexus 5</a>. The Neo Hybrid lasted for over three years. With the Spigen cases, the Nexus was well protected. It did fall from my hands many times, and every time the case protected it well enough. A couple of months back the Spigen case broke, and I had been using the phone without a cover since then. Unfortunately, during one of my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/three_months_to_a_half_marathon/">morning runs</a> the phone fell from my hands while slipping it into the armband. Without the Spigen to protect it, the Nexus screen broke at the corners.</p>

<p><img src="/images/spigen_pixel.png" alt="Spigen Neo Hybrid for Pixel" class="center" /></p>

<p>A month back I switched over to Google Pixel as the Nexus was becoming unusable with the broken screen. I got the <a href="https://www.spigen.com/collections/pixel/products/google-pixel-case-neo-hybrid?variant=29248762049">Spigen NeoHybrid for Pixel</a>. The case provides dual layer protection with TCU and PC bumper and comes with fingerprint resistance. The precise cutouts give easy access to all buttons and fingerprint sensor.</p>

<p>If you are looking to a get a case, check out if <a href="https://www.spigen.com/">Spigen</a> has one for your model!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/review-six-months-and-counting-logitech-mx-master/"/>
    <updated>2016-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/review-six-months-and-counting-logitech-mx-master</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been six months with the <a href="http://amzn.to/2ddLmUf">Logitech MX Master</a> mouse and I absolutely love it for daily use. I picked this mouse a week after reading <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FindingThePerfectMouse.aspx">Hanselman&rsquo;s review</a>. It feels just as it sounded in his review - Perfect!.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-master">
    <img  alt="Logitech MX Master" src="/images/logitech_mxmaster.jpg"/>
</a></p>

<h4><strong>Key Features</strong></h4>

<ul>
<li><p>The mouse fits perfectly into the hand and supports the wrist in a native position. It is suitable for long duration use.</p></li>
<li><p>The battery is rechargeable and the mouse comes with a micro-USB charging cable. After a full charge, the mouse lasts me for 2-3 weeks.   The mouse can be used while charging, so there is no downtime. The LED lights indicate the charge status. If not the software also warns when the battery is low.</p></li>
<li><p>I connect the mouse using the Logitech Unifying Receiver. But the mouse also supports connecting over Bluetooth. This is useful in cases when you want to connect with multiple computers.</p></li>
<li><p>The mouse supports Easy Switch technology.  You can pair up to 3 devices and switch between them using buttons on the bottom side of the mouse. I have not used this feature as I mostly work on just one laptop.</p></li>
<li><p>Darkfield Laser Sensor tracks flawlessly over all surfaces. I use the MX Master across wooden and glass surfaces and find it smooth over both.</p></li>
<li><p>The mouse scroll supports smooth scrolling and &lsquo;Ratchet&rsquo; mode (click, click, click) scroll. It supports automatic and manual mode shifting. So when reading long documents you can be on smooth scrolling and when navigating code or shorter texts you can use Ratchet mode to feel greater control. It also has buttons to</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The mouse has an accompanying software that allows customizations of mouse buttons.</p>

<p><img  alt="Logitech MX Master Software" src="/images/logitech_mxmaster_software.png"/></p>

<p>The software allows setting application specific actions for buttons. For e.g. I have the Gesture button to archive emails in Outlook, &lsquo;Navigate to Definition&rsquo; in Visual Studio, close tab in Chrome etc. You can configure this to any action on applications of your choice (provided it supports keyboard shortcuts that can be linked to).</p>

<p><img  alt="Logitech MX Master Software customizations" src="/images/logitech_mxmaster_customize.png"/></p>

<h4><strong>Issue</strong></h4>

<p>The only issue that I faced so long is with the Mouse scroll mode. The &lsquo;Ratchet&rsquo; mode no longer works for me. It is always in smooth scrolling mode and the mechanical key to shift modes does not work anymore. Google tells me that this is a <a href="https://community.logitech.com/s/question/0D531000051026rCAA">common issue</a> with the mouse .
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR9fLd_ViYw">This video</a> walks through on how to open up the mouse and fix the mechanical part that clicks in to switch the scroll modes. I have not tried this myself as I don&rsquo;t feel much a problem without the Ratchet mode.</p>

<p>Other than the Ratchet mode issue, I have not found any other issues with the mouse.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-productive-offline/"/>
    <updated>2016-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-productive-offline</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month I was in Trivandrum (Kerala, India) for a month&rsquo;s vacation. This was also my first trip back to India after <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">moving to Sydney</a>. While in India I chose not to have a mobile connection and be offline on the go (at home I had a broadband connection). So while traveling places or moving around I had <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/">my mobile</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane_mode">airplane mode</a>. But even then there was time that I resorted to my mobile to spend time. When traveling by bus/train, afternoons in hotels (when everyone rests) etc, I had a lot of &lsquo;me time&rsquo;.</p>

<p><img  alt="Living an offline Life" src="/images/offlinelife.png"/></p>

<p>Below are some of the things that I have my phone geared up for offline mode.</p>

<h4><strong>Blogging</strong></h4>

<p>Blogging is one of the things that I enjoy doing most these days. To keep up with <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">my routine</a>, I try to blog every day to keep up with <a href="/blog/blogging-schedule/">my schedule</a>. I have modified <a href="/blog/optimizing-octopress-workflow-for-new-posts/">my blogging workflow</a> to give the flexibility to blog from any of my devices. Currently, I am writing this blog while on a train and &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline">disconnected</a>&rsquo;. When back home and connected, all the offline content synchronizes through Dropbox. The content written while offline is now available for <a href="/blog/continuos-delivery-of-octopress-blog-using-travisci-and-docker/">publishing from my laptop</a>. Making writing accessible from everywhere helps me to stick with my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">mini habits</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Reading</strong></h4>

<p>I always have books, articles downloaded and available for offline reading. For books, I use the Kindle application. Most of the time I have my Kindle for reading, if not I use the mobile application. For blog posts and articles I use Pocket. Whenever I am connected and find interesting posts to read later, I <a href="https://getpocket.com/add/?ep=1">Add to Pocket</a>. Pocket&rsquo;s mobile application <a href="https://help.getpocket.com/article/960-using-pocket-offline-on-android">downloads articles</a> and makes them available for offline reading.</p>

<p><img alt="Amazon Kindle and Pocket for offline reading" src="/images/offlinelife_reading.png"/></p>

<h4><strong>Game</strong></h4>

<p>I usually do not have many games on my mobile. But in case I feel bored I play the <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/09/25/chrome-t-rex-game/">game available on Chrome browser</a> (only in offline mode). When offline a T. Rex dinosaur comes up in the browser with the message &lsquo;Unable to connect to the Internet&rsquo;. Tapping on the dinosaur starts the game.</p>

<p><img  alt="Google Chrome offline T Rex game" src="/images/offlinelife_chrome_game.gif"/></p>

<h4><strong>To-Do List</strong></h4>

<p>Offline time is good to manage your To-Do lists and <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">do a brain dump</a>. I use Todoist to manage my tasks and activities. The <a href="https://support.todoist.com/hc/en-us/articles/205383721-Apps">Todoist mobile application</a> stores all tasks offline. It allows adding tasks when disconnected and synchronizes it to the server when connected. I also use OneNote for capturing notes which also has an offline mode.</p>

<h4><strong>Trip Planner</strong></h4>

<p>For short local trips, the recently launched <a href="https://get.google.com/trips/">Google Trips</a> is useful. Google Now already shows trip summaries and alerts on the home page. Google Trips takes this to the next level and allows to manage all trip data at one place. It helps collate all the travel booking in one place and makes it available in offline mode.</p>

<p><img  alt="Google Trips for managing trip data offline" src="/images/offlinelife_trips.png"/></p>

<p>These are the common things that I have my mobile setup for offline mode. I have had this setup while I was in Sydney, as I try to stay disconnected when commuting to work. Staying off the internet helps me get more things done!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-10T16:08:29+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gadgets, especially mobile phones have always been of interest to me and so is it even today. Its been over two months since I have moved over to Android on Nexus 5. I have been a loyal, hardcore Windows phone fan for over 3 years before that and it did take time to get used to the new operating system. There are still things that I like about Windows phone but there are things that I don’t like too, so I though of giving Android a try. <a href="https://www.google.com/nexus/5/">Nexus 5</a> is one powerful device that is worth every penny for its power packed features and there is no reason not to like it. The <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/10/20/weekend-poll-nexus-5-white-or-black/">White vs Black</a> confusion was there but then I got the White one, as that was the only thing in stock, and after all with a protective cover on, it didn’t matter much.</p>

<p><strong>Things that I love:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Notification</strong> : The one stop place for all notifications is one of the best things that I like moving to Android from Windows phone. A <a href="http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC619123.png">missed toast</a> is always missed until I next decide to open that app in Windows phone or maybe a lock screen notification. But now it is right there on the notification center. (though I have many notifications turned off as part of <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-organized-finding-a-system-to-manage-it-all/">Staying Organized</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Toggle Settings : <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.painless.pc">Toggling settings</a></strong> like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G etc is also top on my likes. There is at least 2 steps required for toggling these settings in Windows phone</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google Now : </strong>I have been googling around for a lot of years and like the way Google Now updates on searches that I have done. Yes I know that we have a privacy problem here, but I have decided to stay on the internet – everything gets tracked here. The <strong>speech recognition</strong> of Google is as best it can get today, best thing being it understands my accent (Indian) pretty much all the time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apps: </strong>I have never been a fan of apps and I rarely used them. Windows phone did have all the major apps, but most of them lacked all the features because of which I had to switch to the web app at times. This in fact made me use the web app always. But Android apps mostly has all the features which makes me use them more. Some of the apps that I use regularly are :</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely">Timely</a> : An awesome alarm clock with the cool Smart Rise feature</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm">Gmail</a> : With all the features of the web app</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.raider">Skype</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.lync15">Lync</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp">Whatsapp</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android">Twitter</a>: Helps me keep connected with my friends, peers and customers</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.giant">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android">Wordpress</a> – For keeping track of my blog</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2">Authenticator</a> – for all two-step verification codes</p></li>

GitHub has a lot more to improve on features.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stitcher.app">Stitcher</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly">Feedly</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.beyondpod">BeyondPod</a> – For feeds and podcasts</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.onenote">OneNote</a> and the native email app - For tracking notes, <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-organized-finding-a-system-to-manage-it-all/">tasks and exchange emails</a>. The native email application has a lot of scope for improvement</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alienmanfc6.wheresmyandroid">Where&rsquo;s My Droid</a> - Finding a lost phone equivalent on Windows Phone.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle">Kindle</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overdrive.mobile.android.mediaconsole">Overdrive</a> - For my kindle books and audio books</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock">DashClock Widget</a> - For lock screen notifications</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ro.weednet.contactssync">UberSync</a> – To sync facebook contacts and profile pictures to a contact. This is something that is really good in windows phone. Ability to link all social accounts of a person/contact.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Customization: </strong>The level of customization and control that each application gives is enormous that almost everything is configurable. You can mute/turn off notifications on annoying text promotion messages, different color notifications, auto update settings and a lot more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chrome: </strong>This definitely is one another on my top likes. I have been using chrome for a long time and absolutely love the experience even on android. The password sync across devices is cool and so is <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2591582?hl=en">Sync tabs across devices</a>. Bookmarks sync and support for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delicious">Delicious</a> is also good. IE definitely has a long way to go there. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging">developer support</a> for chrome on android is also worth mentioning.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Things that I don’t like and miss:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Jumplist: <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/windows-phone-series-jump-lists/">Jumplists</a></strong> really made navigating through large lists a lot easier on Windows phone. Now I always need to hit the search button and type.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>People Hub: </strong>This was one of the best things of Windows phone, having the ability to <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/people/people-hub?signin=true">link all your social networks</a> into one and have a quick access of all updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nokia Music and Drive: </strong>In fact all the Nokia suite apps were really good and especially these two.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The lists itself explains much of it – <strong>I am liking it a lot. </strong>The android experience on a Nexus device is fast and smooth.</p>

<p><strong>Cases and Covers:</strong></p>

<p>I have been alternating between 2 cases for my Nexus 5 from Spigen and liking them both especially the Neo Hybrid. The white shows of through its transparent back and the overall grip on the phone is very good and comfortable.</p>

<p>The <strong>battery</strong> backup on the device is pretty good and is lasting for me through a day. I have not yet been on any trips with the phone, so can’t comment on the battery in such situations where generally it lasts lesser. But <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/google-working-nexus-5-battery-drain-fix-affects-all-android-devices-kitkat-qualcomm-chips-1559771">Google has also announced</a> on a battery leak issue for which a fix would be out soon. Hope that would improve it further. I have never been a fan of phone <strong>camera, </strong>since <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/photography-learning-to-click/">I prefer my DSLR</a> for that, but even then for a camera it is pretty decent with lots of options and filters. At times it does come handy and works perfect.</p>

<p>If you are planning to get a new phone and then this is worth considering. If you are already using one then do let know on what you feel about the phone?</p>
