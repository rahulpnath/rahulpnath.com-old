    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gadgets, especially mobile phones have always been of interest to me and so is it even today. Its been over two months since I have moved over to Android on Nexus 5. I have been a loyal, hardcore Windows phone fan for over 3 years before that and it did take time to get used to the new operating system. There are still things that I like about Windows phone but there are things that I don’t like too, so I though of giving Android a try. <a href="https://www.google.com/nexus/5/">Nexus 5</a> is one powerful device that is worth every penny for its power packed features and there is no reason not to like it. The <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/10/20/weekend-poll-nexus-5-white-or-black/">White vs Black</a> confusion was there but then I got the White one, as that was the only thing in stock, and after all with a protective cover on, it didn’t matter much.</p>

<p><strong>Things that I love:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Notification</strong> : The one stop place for all notifications is one of the best things that I like moving to Android from Windows phone. A <a href="http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC619123.png">missed toast</a> is always missed until I next decide to open that app in Windows phone or maybe a lock screen notification. But now it is right there on the notification center. (though I have many notifications turned off as part of <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-organized-finding-a-system-to-manage-it-all/">Staying Organized</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Toggle Settings : <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.painless.pc">Toggling settings</a></strong> like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G etc is also top on my likes. There is at least 2 steps required for toggling these settings in Windows phone</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google Now : </strong>I have been googling around for a lot of years and like the way Google Now updates on searches that I have done. Yes I know that we have a privacy problem here, but I have decided to stay on the internet – everything gets tracked here. The <strong>speech recognition</strong> of Google is as best it can get today, best thing being it understands my accent (Indian) pretty much all the time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apps: </strong>I have never been a fan of apps and I rarely used them. Windows phone did have all the major apps, but most of them lacked all the features because of which I had to switch to the web app at times. This in fact made me use the web app always. But Android apps mostly has all the features which makes me use them more. Some of the apps that I use regularly are :</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely">Timely</a> : An awesome alarm clock with the cool Smart Rise feature</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm">Gmail</a> : With all the features of the web app</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.raider">Skype</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.lync15">Lync</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp">Whatsapp</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android">Twitter</a>: Helps me keep connected with my friends, peers and customers</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.giant">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android">Wordpress</a> – For keeping track of my blog</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2">Authenticator</a> – for all two-step verification codes</p></li>

The native email application has a lot of scope for improvement</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle">Kindle</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overdrive.mobile.android.mediaconsole">Overdrive</a> - For my kindle books and audio books</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock">DashClock Widget</a> - For lock screen notifications</p></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Customization: </strong>The level of customization and control that each application gives is enormous that almost everything is configurable. You can mute/turn off notifications on annoying text promotion messages, different color notifications, auto update settings and a lot more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chrome: </strong>This definitely is one another on my top likes. I have been using chrome for a long time and absolutely love the experience even on android. The password sync across devices is cool and so is <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2591582?hl=en">Sync tabs across devices</a>. Bookmarks sync and support for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delicious">Delicious</a> is also good. IE definitely has a long way to go there. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging">developer support</a> for chrome on android is also worth mentioning.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Things that I don’t like and miss:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Jumplist: <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/windows-phone-series-jump-lists/">Jumplists</a></strong> really made navigating through large lists a lot easier on Windows phone. Now I always need to hit the search button and type.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>People Hub: </strong>This was one of the best things of Windows phone, having the ability to <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/people/people-hub?signin=true">link all your social networks</a> into one and have a quick access of all updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nokia Music and Drive: </strong>In fact all the Nokia suite apps were really good and especially these two.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The lists itself explains much of it – <strong>I am liking it a lot. </strong>The android experience on a Nexus device is fast and smooth.</p>

<p><strong>Cases and Covers:</strong></p>

<p>I have been alternating between 2 cases for my Nexus 5 from Spigen and liking them both especially the Neo Hybrid. The white shows of through its transparent back and the overall grip on the phone is very good and comfortable.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00HYA10LC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=B00HYA10LC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21">Spigen Google Nexus 5 Case ULTRA HYBRID</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00EV8Y6QQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=B00EV8Y6QQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21">Spigen Google Nexus 5 Case Protective Neo Hybrid</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>The <strong>battery</strong> backup on the device is pretty good and is lasting for me through a day. I have not yet been on any trips with the phone, so can’t comment on the battery in such situations where generally it lasts lesser. But <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/google-working-nexus-5-battery-drain-fix-affects-all-android-devices-kitkat-qualcomm-chips-1559771">Google has also announced</a> on a battery leak issue for which a fix would be out soon. Hope that would improve it further. I have never been a fan of phone <strong>camera, </strong>since <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/photography-learning-to-click/">I prefer my DSLR</a> for that, but even then for a camera it is pretty decent with lots of options and filters. At times it does come handy and works perfect.</p>

<p>If you are planning to get a new phone and then this is worth considering. If you are already using one then do let know on what you feel about the phone?</p>

    <updated>2013-01-05T16:37:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/what-made-me-choose-vanguard-up-rise-45</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Deciding on a dslr was not so tough a year back, it was either Canon or Nikon and it just happened that i chose Canon since in the beginner level series neither seemed to make a difference, at least for me. I have a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-550D-Digital-Camera-Body/dp/B0037KM0EY">Canon 550d</a> with a set of beginner level lenses (a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-S-18-55mm-3-5-5-6-II/dp/B000V5K3FG/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357390070&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=canon+18-55">18-55mm</a> kit lens, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-Camera-Lens/dp/B00007E7JU/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357390018&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=canon+50mm+1.8">50mm</a> prime and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-55-250mm-4-0-5-6-Telephoto-Digital/dp/B0011NVMO8">55-250mm</a> telephoto zoom) and a tripod(1.3 kg ,folded height 460mm).
For over an year I was using the bag that came with my dslr and decided now to upgrade to a better one, as I found it difficult to carry around the camera, lenses and tripod. I was looking for a backpack model and with lots of brands out there choosing one was really a tough thing. At first I did want to have a bag that could take a laptop too, but then decided against it as all those bags that could take a laptop tend to be a bit bulky. Carrying a laptop would be only while I travel and not when I go out for shooting, so then decided against one with a laptop. After some online research I shortlisted a couple of bags.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://products.lowepro.com/product/flipside-300,2083.htm">Lowepro Flipside 300</a></li>
<li><a href="http://products.lowepro.com/product/DSLR-Video%20Fastpack%20250%20AW,2282.htm">Lowepro Video Fastpack 250aw</a></li>
<li><a href="http://products.lowepro.com/product/Pro-Runner-200-AW,2181,14.htm">Lowepro Pro Runner 200AW</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.manfrotto.com/product/0/MB%2BSB390-3BC/_/Veloce_III_Camera_Backpack_for_DSLR_(Bungee_Cord)">Manfrotto Veloce III</a></li>
</ol>


<p>Deciding to drop into a store to see them was the best thing that I did, and I suggest everyone planning to buy a dslr bag to do that. What’s good for me, might not work out for you. Except the flipside one I did see everything else. For me the fastpack 250aw was a bit bulky, the Pro Runner a bit too small and lacking a quick access entry. Manfrotto was decent enough but then my tripod would not go through the tripod strap, since my tripod has all its legs connected to the centre rod.
I happened to see the Vanguard Up-rise 43, which was actually a sling bag but had all the other features I was looking for. It was sleek looking, well padded,had a tripod holder(now this one had a adjustable strap to hold the tripod), a quick access,rain cover.
Back home I did again a bit of research and got to see the Up-rise 45,46 and 48, which is the backpack bags in the up-rise series . Now that was what exactly I was looking for. 48 was way too big for me. Now had to choose between the 46 and 45 the only difference being the former could take a laptop too,and was not that bulky too. Also the models are also different. For Up-rise 46 the bag opening was from the <a href="http://www.premier-ink.co.uk/images/images_big/vg_uprise46_1.jpg">front</a> and for Up-rise 45 the opening was from the <a href="http://img2.blogs.yahoo.co.jp/ybi/1/7a/03/shira_gon/folder/1199363/img_1199363_32950708_2?1268142426">back</a>. The Up-rise 46 had just one problem of having the tripod strap on the opening bag flap, having you to untie the tripod first(if you have used that to tie the tripod. This one also does have a elastic band to the middle of the bag through which you can slide your tripod in, as in manfrotto. But then my tripod had to tied using the strap due to the same problem mentioned above).
So finally I had a choice, <a href="http://www.vanguardworld.com/index.php/en/pv/products/detail-1-1-4-33.html">Vanguard Up-Rise 45</a>, at least for now that I feel might be good for me. Just got it shipped today and planning to take it with me for the next trip.
Below are some snaps of the my bag. I did find a good <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A4GN5lJhQY">video</a> on youtube which shows all the features, so I didn’t want to do one again.</p>

Of all the mobiles I have used till date this one goes top on my rating.With its elegant design,built quality and power packed features,the N95 8GB was worth every penny spent.8GB was not much of an attraction though, but definitely it being internal memory,boosted the performance.No longer I felt the time lag in apps opening,as in the previous models of Nokia.<br/>
Though its been a long time this big monster has been released it demands this piece of space here. <br/>
Not going into the specs of the phone,for there are sites which gives them in and out like this one <a href="http://www.phonearena.com/htmls/Nokia-N95-8GB-phone-p_2344.html">here</a>.<br/>
The 5 mega pixel camera is definitely a lookout feature,for you no more need a dedicated camera,if all you want is a snap of the moment.<br/>
The two way slide feature with dedicated music keys makes it to be on the race with pmp&rsquo;s out in the store,with the battery lasting pretty enough for an average music lover.<br/>
With the wide range of apps available for the symbian os , this definitely was the king of its times&hellip;..Nokia N95 8GB</p>

With all banks stopping on EMI(Equated Monthly Installment),with recession at its high,I was left with no choice for a long time,but to depend on internet cafe&rsquo;s,as my compaq V2624TU got some hardware problems and wouldn&rsquo;t start up.Blogging was on the verge of stopping&hellip;..thanks to my brother,Sagar,who turned my new banker for the brand new HP DV4.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot bro :)</p>

<p>Got to start saving though,for always bankers might not be there nor will EMI&rsquo;s(they really helped for my previous purchases).<br/>
Hoping to make it a resolution(you always want something&rsquo;s to be broken),for the year 2010.</p>

<p>Happy New Year :)</p>
