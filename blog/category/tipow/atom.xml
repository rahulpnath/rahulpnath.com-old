    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the blazing fast internet speeds at work (and at home) it might be hard to imagine how sites would work for people with a lower bandwidth. When developing for the Web, it is good to keep in mind that people from various regions across the globe might access your site. Internet speeds are not that fast around the world. So it is essential to test how your website performs for people on a lower bandwidth.</p>

<p>There are a lot of plugins and external tools that can simulate a lower bandwidth scenario and makes testing on slower bandwidth easier. If you are using Google Chrome, then you already have one such tool under your belt. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/reference#throttling">Network tab</a> under Google Chrome Developer Tools has an option to set different bandwidth profiles. Setting this to a profile that you want, and launching the site forces the site load on the set bandwidth.</p>

<p><img src="/images/chrome_network_delay.png" alt="Google Chrome Developer Tools - Network Delay" class="center" /></p>

<p>There are many default bandwidth profiles in there, and it also allows you to add custom profiles if required. There is also an option to simulate offline mode, to test how the application behaves without an internet connection (if that applies to you). However such testing is mostly restricted to manual testing, and for automating this, you might have to look for external tools.</p>

<p>Hope this helps optimize your site for lower bandwidth!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/hemingway-editor/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/hemingway-editor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time. Remember this in moments of despair. If you find that writing is hard, it&rsquo;s because it is hard.</em></p>

<p>&ndash; William Zinsser, On Writing Well</p></blockquote>

<p>Editing is the hardest part of writing and one that I skip the most. I try hard not to skip editing, but often I end up being lazy to do the hard work. I try to cover this up with some tools to make it faster. It is hard for one tool to get it all right. So it&rsquo;s best if you have a range of tools under your belt to support you with writing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">The Hemingway Editor</a> highlights hard to read sentences, adverbs, complicated phrases, etc. The writing app uses different colors to highlight the various issues as shown below. The editor also shows a summary of the text including the reading time, total words, sentences etc. The app also shows a <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/help.html">Readability Grade</a> using Automated Readability Index.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hemingway.png" alt="Hemingway Editor"></p>

<p>The Hemingway Editor is available for free on the web with lesser features. The web application does not let you save your work. You are always at risk of loosing the work if you are authoring on the site.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/desktop.html">Windows/Mac applications</a> supports a larger set of features but for a price. The desktop application works without an internet connection, allows publishing to Wordpress/Medium. It also supports to exporting to different formats (word, pdf, html, markdown etc.).</p>

<p>I use the Hemingway Editor (on the web) occasionally and find it useful at times. It&rsquo;s good to double check for any issues before publishing the post. Hope this helps you as well in your writing.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/beyond-compare-compare-files-quick-and-easy/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/beyond-compare-compare-files-quick-and-easy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Merging conflicts can be a pain when working in large teams and code bases change fast. Every time you sync with the main code base you need to make sure that you integrate the updates with your work in progress. It&rsquo;s great when the changes get automatically merged by the source control systems. But when things need to be manually merged is where a good tool can be of help.</p>

<p><img src="/images/beyond_compare.png" class="center" alt="Beyond Compare"></p>

<blockquote><p><em><a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/index.php">Beyond Compare</a> allows you to quickly and easily compare your files and folders.  By using simple, powerful commands, you can focus on the differences you&rsquo;re interested in and ignore those you&rsquo;re not.  You can then merge the changes, synchronize your files, and generate reports for your records.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/features.php?zz=features_multifaceted">Text Compare</a> viewer is the one that I use most frequently to compare or merge different versions of code. Beyond Compare makes it easy to spot the code differences and gives the capability to copy the code from one version to another. One can also copy portions of changes and merge just that instead of all the changes. The 3-Way Text Merge feature is also useful, especially when you are using Git.</p>

<p>Beyond Compare has a Standard and a Pro Edition with a lot of <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/features.php?zz=features_list">features</a>. I have the Pro Edition license for Beyond Compare, thanks to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">Readify</a> for the Software allowance that you get every year.</p>

<p>Beyond Compare is one of the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">tools that I use almost daily</a>. Check it out if you have not already.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/fiddler-free-web-debugging-proxy/"/>
    <updated>2017-06-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/fiddler-free-web-debugging-proxy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> is an HTTP debugging proxy server application and captures HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It is one of the tools in my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">essential toolkit list</a>. Fiddler allows debugging traffic from PC, MAC, Linux and mobile systems. It helps inspect the raw requests and responses between the client and the server.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fiddler_inspectors.png" alt="Fiddler" class="center" ></p>

<p>Some of the key features that I often use in Fiddler are</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/Observe-Traffic/Tasks/ViewSessionContent">Inspect Request/Response</a>
Look into the request and response data to see if all the required headers/attributes are set, and the data is sent as expected</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/using-fiddler-to-help-in-manual-testing/">Compose Web Requests</a>
Manually compose requests to send to server and test endpoints.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/simulating-delays-in-http-calls-for-manual-tests/">AutoRespond to Requests</a>
Intercept requests from the browser and send back a pre-defined response or create a delay in response to the actual client.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/Observe-Traffic/Tasks/ViewSessionStatistics">Statistics</a>
Fiddler statistics give an overview of the performance details of a web session, indicating where the time is spent in the whole request/response cycle.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/Generate-Traffic/Tasks/ResendRequest">Modify and Replay a Request</a>
Fiddler allows modifying the request by editing its contents and replay the message to the server.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/Save-And-Load-Traffic/Tasks/CreateSAZ">Export and Import</a>
Fiddler makes it easy to share captured traces with different people. All captured traffic or selected requests can be exported and shared with others. The exported saz file can be opened in Fiddler to view back all the session details.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These are some of the features that I use on a regular basis. Fiddler supports a lot more and is extensible to support custom requirements as well. I find it an indispensable tool when developing for the Web. <a href="https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler">Get Fiddler</a> if you have not already.</p>
