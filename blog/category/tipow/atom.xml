    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I upload images to my blog, I try to keep the file size as small as possible. Reducing image size helps improve the site load time. To grab screenshots I use <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/screenshots-with-snagit/">Snagit</a> and use <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/paint-dot-net/">Paint.net</a> for any editing and resizing the images.</p>

<p>To further optimize images and compress them I use <a href="">PNGGauntlet</a><a href="https://pnggauntlet.com/.">https://pnggauntlet.com/.</a> PNGGauntlet combines <a href="http://advsys.net/ken/util/pngout.htm">PNGOUT</a>, <a href="http://optipng.sourceforge.net/">OptiPNG</a> and DeflOpt and helps smash PNG&rsquo;s to the smallest size.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pnggauntlet.png" alt="PNG Gauntlet" class="center" /></p>

<p>PNGGauntlet provides options to configure the PNG output. You can play around with the options for the best output. I use the default options and has been working fine for me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For my blog&rsquo;s I often have to edit, resize, modify images often. The default paint application with Windows lacks a lot of features while <a href="http://www.adobe.com/au/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a> is too advanced for my needs. <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/index.html">Paint.net</a> is a freely available tool with many advanced features and is lightweight.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Paint.NET is free image and photo editing software for PCs that run Windows. It features an intuitive and innovative user interface with support for layers, unlimited undo, special effects, and a wide variety of useful and powerful tools</em></p></blockquote>

</a></p>

<p>In addition to the basic features expected off an image editing tool, paint.net supports layers, create special effects with unlimited history/undo. It also includes gradient tool, Magic Wand, Clone Stamp, etc. for advanced editing. Every action performed on the image is recorded in the History window and allows undoing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/pocket.jpg" alt="Pocket" class="center" /></p>

<p>I try to stay offline for fixed times during the day and often <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-productive-offline/">prepare myself up for it</a>. Having things to read is one of the important things to it. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/feedly-one-stop-reading-place/">Feedly</a> allows to keep track of all the reading sources that I have, while I am online. Some articles need more time and focus to be well understood, and I often end up &lsquo;Saving them for Later.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> is an app that helps manage articles that you wish to read later. You can save articles, videos or pretty much anything into Pocket and view them later. The best thing about Pocket is that on mobile devices, it allows offline reading - i.e., without the need for an internet connection.</p>

<p>Pocket has <a href="https://getpocket.com/add/?ep=1">apps and browser extensions</a> for a variety of platforms making it easy to save articles that you find interesting. You can save to pocket while on your laptop or your mobile devices and have it available for later reading. Feedly integrates with Pocket and allows to save articles for future reading straight to Pocket. I am using the free version of Pocketand it works perfectly for me. But if you are interested in more advanced features you can upgrade to the <a href="https://getpocket.com/premium?ep=1">Premium version</a>.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t miss out on that article that you want to read (later), <a href="https://getpocket.com">Get Pocket</a>!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/password-manager-get-one-if-you-havent-already/"/>
    <updated>2017-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/password-manager-get-one-if-you-havent-already</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/password_manager.jpg" alt ="https://pixabay.com/en/data-security-keyboard-computer-1590455/" class="center" /></p>

<p>First things first; <strong>Check if any of your accounts on the web has been compromised in the various data breaches</strong>. All you need is enter your email address in <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned</a>, and it tells you the rest.</p>

<p>My email did show up on multiple breaches, and there is nothing much that you can do about it anyways. The problem with data breaches is not confined just to the site that got breached but also with other sites if you have reused your passwords. The best that we can do is to use different passwords for each account that we create and never reuse them across sites. Also, remember to use &lsquo;stronger&rsquo; passwords. So what makes a password stronger? - <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/only-secure-password-is-one-you-cant/">The one that you cannot remember</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">Password manager</a> assists in generating, storing, and retrieving complex passwords from an encrypted database</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Password Managers allows keeping all your passwords in a single strongly encrypted location. This manager itself is protected by a password - the master password!. The master password is the only password that you need to remember, so make sure you <a href="https://support.1password.com/strong-master-password/">get this really strong</a>!</p>

<p>There are different <a href="http://au.pcmag.com/password-managers-products/4524/guide/the-best-password-managers-of-2017">password managers</a> out there, both paid and free. Personally, I use <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> and love the experience that it has across all my devices. Initially, I was worried to have my passwords (password since I was mostly reusing the same one) on a cloud store with an external service. But with all these data breaches that I was part of and having realized that not having one is worse than having it in the cloud. <em><a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-managers-dont-have-to-be-perfect-they-just-have-to-be-better-than-not-having-one/">Password managers don&rsquo;t have to be perfect, they just have to be better than not having one</a></em>. Having a password manager does not prevent your from being part of data breaches, but at least it protects your accounts elsewhere as you have not reused the password.</p>

<p>So if you still remember your passwords or reuse them, go set yourself up with a password manager!</p>
