<p>I have been using Cmder as my command line for around two years and been loving it. I am not a super user of the command line, but try to use it more and more.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of good console emulator on Windows. It is based on ConEmu with major config overhaul, comes with a Monokai color scheme, and a custom prompt layout.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This is not right with Windows 10, as there is a new command prompt which has a lot more features. I have not yet thought of moving to that as Cmder has been working well for me.</p>

<h4><strong>Installation and setting up</strong></h4>

<p>Cmder is open source and free to download from <a href="http://cmder.net/">Cmder.net</a>. One of the advantages of Cmder is its portability. You can carry it with you on a USB stick or in the Cloud, so all your settings can go anywhere you go. Installation is simple, all you need to do is download the latest release, extract the archive and run Cmder executable. Check out the documentation if you face any difficulties.</p>

<h4><strong>Features I Like</strong></h4>

<p>Able to <strong><em>paste into the console using the Windows shortcut Ctrl + V</em></strong> is one of the key things that got me started with this command line tool. It also supports most of the other text traversal keyboard shortcuts of Windows.</p>

<p>Cmder supports <strong><em>multiple console tabs within a window</em></strong>. Tabs makes having multiple consoles open and managing them easy. All tab manipulation has associated keyboard shortcuts making it even faster. When creating a new tab, using Ctrl + T, you can choose to run different predefined tasks on command line startup. You can also set the user and user rights to run them as. Setting up the predefined tasks is under Settings -> Startup->Tasks.  I have added <strong><em>custom tasks</em></strong> for PowerShell, and Visual Studio developer command prompt as that is what I use mostly.</p>

<div id="customtasks" ></div>


<pre><code class="text Powershell Administrator Task">*PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NoProfile -NoExit -Command 
"Invoke-Expression '. ''%ConEmuDir%\..\profile.ps1'''" -new_console:d:"%USERPROFILE%"
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text Visual Studio Developer Prompt Task">cmd /k ""%ConEmuDir%\..\init.bat" &amp; 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat"" 
-new_console:d:%USERPROFILE%
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Alias</em></strong> is one of the key features that keeps me to Cmder. You can create short commands to map to longer commands. Aliases avoid typing long commands every time you want to perform that action. You can see all existing aliases by running alias command. I use this feature a lot. Most of the git commands are aliases, so I do not have to type them every time. For e.g., when on a git repository I can type <em>gs</em> to run git status. You can also pass arguments to alias. To do a git commit with a message I run <em>gc The commit message</em>. Aliases support optional parameters through the $1-9 or the $*.</p>

<p>To define a alias <em>alias gs=git status</em>. Below are some of the alias examples.</p>

<pre><code class="text Alias Examples">gl=git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate  $*
gs=git status
ga=git add -A
gc=git commit -m "$*"
gcb=git checkout -b $*
gpsu=git push --set-upstream origin $*
</code></pre>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpxx8hlNTzc">video</a> for a walk-through of the setup and its usage. Cmder allows to get things done fast and looks great. Try it out to see if it works for you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Keyboard Shortcuts" src="/images/keyboard_shortcuts.jpg" /></p>

<p>I prefer to use the keyboard to navigate within sites I use frequently. Keyboard enables to navigate faster within site and perform tasks quicker. The <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-six-months-and-counting-logitech-mx-master/">Logitech MX Master</a> mouse provides a lot of capabilities to navigate. But I find the keyboard faster to perform repetitive actions - like posting a new status update on social media sites, managing tasks in Jira, TFS online, GitHub, responding to emails, Todoist, etc. Finding keyboard shortcuts on these various sites can itself be a daunting task. One might need to google to get the shortcuts or find the relevant documentation on the site. Luckily most of the popular sites today display a pop-up modal with all the keyboard shortcuts for the site when pressing <strong>Shift + ?</strong>. Note that this might not work on all the sites out there. But for most of the common ones that I use l, I find it working.</p>

<p>So the next time you spend a lot of time on a website try hitting <strong>Shift + ?</strong> to look for supported keyboard shortcuts.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are the kind of person that likes to listen to some music while working, then this one is for you. Music is proven to have significant effects on improving focus while working. But it is also quite possible to get fully immersed in the music and forget all about work. Different kinds of music contribute to improving concentration while not getting immersed in the music itself. I usually <a href="http://theheadphonesrule.com/">wear my headphones</a> at work while working and listen to music.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Music helps to minimize distractions and helps you reach a state of <a href="http://amzn.to/2jlYIgV">Flow</a>, which is ideal for improving productivity.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>At times I like to hear to just some background noises simulating different environments. <a href="https://www.noisli.com/">Noisli</a> is an application that helps mix different sounds and create your perfect environment. The sounds could either be working in a restaurant or while it&rsquo;s raining with thunder, in a forest, by the side of the fire, etc. It helps create the mood that you want and helps recreate it with sound. Since the noises are of a fixed pattern, you soon get used to it and improves concentration at work.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Noisli - Favorite Combos" src="/images/noisli_favorite.png" /></p>

<p>Here are my favorite mixes in Noisli.
<a href="https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/W5rvjLZXcoJbooq">Rain Mix</a>, <a href="https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/vjUpcG2OAXxKVSU">Jungle</a>, <a href="https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/uhRXMysAIcVEbHF">TRain</a>, <a href="https://www.noisli.com/get_combo_by_link/gFKhnETdoybxcmc">HotelRainFire</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I share a lot of information copying and pasting from websites. Most of the times I want to share just the text and not any formatting. To remove any text formatting, I copy it into Notepad and then onto the destination. Yesterday I found that using <strong>Ctrl + Shift + V</strong> to paste (instead of <em>Ctrl + V</em>) removes all text formatting.</p>

<p>As shown, when using Ctrl + V the text gets copied along with the formatting as shown below.</p>

<p><img alt="Paste With Formatting" src="/images/paste_with_formatting.png" /></p>

<p>When using Ctrl + Shift + V, only the text gets copied and the formatting is ignored.
<img alt="Paste Without Formatting" src="/images/paste_without_formatting.png" /></p>

<p>Using this shortcut saves time as I no longer need to open Notepad for this!</p>

<p>PS: As one of my readers rightly pointed out (below in the comments), this might not work on all applications. I have tried this on Chrome Browser and Lync For Business and worked fine.</p>
