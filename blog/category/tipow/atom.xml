    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often when working with SQL queries, I come across the need to capitalize SQL keywords across in a large query. For, e.g., to capitalize SELECT, WHERE, FROM clauses in an SQL query. When it is a large query/stored procedure, it is faster done using some text editor. Sublime Text is my preferred editor for such kind of text manipulations.</p>

<p>Sublime Text Editor comes with a few built-in text casing converters that we can use, to convert text from one case to another. Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_editing">simultaneous editing</a> feature, we can combine it with case conversion and manipulate large documents easily.</p>

<p><img src="/images/textediting_convert_case.png" alt="Convert case options in sublime text" ></p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say I have this below SQL query. As you can notice the SELECT and FROM keywords are cased differently across the query.</p>

<pre><code class="sql">select * From Table1
select * From Table2
select * From Table3
SELECT * FROM Table4
Select * From Table5
</code></pre>

<p>To standardize this (preferably capitalize all), highlight one of the &lsquo;select&rsquo; keywords and highlight all occurrences of the keyword (ALT + F3). Once all occurrences of &lsquo;select&rsquo; is highlighted, bring up the <a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/command_palette.html">command pallete</a> (CTRL + SHIFT + P on windows) and search for &lsquo;Convert Case&rsquo;. From the options listed choose the case that you want to convert. All selected occurrences of the keyword will now be in the selected case.</p>

<p>Hope this helps you when you have a lot of text case manipulations to be done.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/laps-in-training-mode-garmin-watches/"/>
    <updated>2017-12-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/laps-in-training-mode-garmin-watches</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently upgraded to a Garmin Fenix 3 HR from my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/three_months_to_a_half_marathon/">Forerunner 630</a>. After a few runs with the Fenix 3, I realized that in <a href="https://twitter.com/rahulpnath/status/928145529606873088">Training Mode it does not do auto lap</a>. I have a custom training workout for a 10k with no repeat modes in it. This workout was what I used on my FR630, and it used to auto lap at 1km. That no longer happens in the Fenix 3 HR.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Software Details</strong></p>

<p><em>Fenix 3 HR</em>: 4.70</p>

<p><em>Forerunner 630</em>: 7.50(bdd586f)</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/garmin_auto_lap_training.png" alt="Garming Auto Lap Not working in Training Mode, Fenix 3 HR" /></p>

<p>After googling around, I understood the auto lap under training mode is a feature only available to specific models/software versions. One of the reasoning behind it is auto lap might create issues if people are training in intervals larger than 1km. Breaking into laps at every 1km will make it harder/nearly impossible to compare their intervals. For workouts that you want auto lap at 1km (or at any custom distances), you can use Repeat feature as shown below. Setting up the workout as 10 x 1km helps to analyze the run at 1km intervals.</p>

<p><img src="/images/garmin_auto_lap_training_repeat.png" alt="Garming Auto Lap Using Repeat, Fenix 3 HR" /></p>

<p>Depending on the model/software version of your Garmin watch you might have to tweak your workout plans. Hope this helps</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/postman-chaining-requests-to-speed-up-manual-api-tests/"/>
    <updated>2017-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/postman-chaining-requests-to-speed-up-manual-api-tests</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was recently playing around with <a href="https://www.messagemedia.com.au/">MessageMedia API</a> trying to <a href="https://developers.messagemedia.com/code/messages-api-documentation/">send SMS and get the status of the SMS sent</a>. Sending the SMS and getting the status of the last sent SMS always happened in succession when testing it manually. Once I send the message, I waited for the API response, grabbed the message id from the response and used that to form the get status request.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> is a useful tool if you are building or testing APIs. It allows to create, send and manage API requests.</p>

<p><img src="/images/postman_chaining_requests.png" alt="Postman Chaining Requests" /></p>

<p>I added two requests and saved it to a collection in Postman - one to Send Message and other to Get Message status. I have created an environment variable for holding the message id. For the request that sends a message, the below Test snippet is added. It parses the response body of the request and extracts the message id of the last send message. This is then saved to the environment variable. The <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/test_scripts">Test</a> snippet is always run after performing the request.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var jsonData = JSON.parse(responseBody);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable("messageId", jsonData.messages[0].message_id);
tests["Success"]= true;
</code></pre>

<p>The Get message request uses the messageId from the environment variables to construct its URL. The URL looks like below.</p>

<p>
<code>text
https://api.messagemedia.com/v1/messages/{{messageId}}
</code>
</p>

<p>When executing this request, it fetches the messageId from the environment variable, which is set by the previous request. You no longer have to copy message id manually and use it in the URL. This is how we chain the data from one request to another request. Chaining requests is also useful in automated testing using Postman. Hope this helps!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Tip of the Week: Text Editing - Extract Data]]></title>
    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/text-editing-extract-data/"/>
    <updated>2017-10-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/text-editing-extract-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At times you might need to extract data from a large text. Let&rsquo;s say you have a JSON response, and you want to extract all the <em>id</em> fields in the response and <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/text-editing-split-or-combine-multiple-lines/">combine them as comma separated</a>. Here&rsquo;s how you can easily extract data from large text using Sublime (or any other text editor that supports simultaneous editing).</p>

<pre><code class="json https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts">[
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
    "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto"
  },
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 2,
    "title": "qui est esse",
    "body": "est rerum tempore vitae\nsequi sint nihil reprehenderit dolor beatae ea dolores neque\nfugiat blanditiis voluptate porro vel nihil molestiae ut reiciendis\nqui aperiam non debitis possimus qui neque nisi nulla"
  },
  ...
]
</code></pre>

<p>Again the key here is to select the recurring pattern first. In this case, it is <em>&ldquo;id&rdquo;:</em> and then selecting all occurrences of that. Once all occurrences are selected, we can select the whole line and extract that out. Repeat the same to remove the <em>id</em> text. Then follow the same steps we used to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/text-editing-split-or-combine-multiple-lines/">combine text</a>.</p>

<p>Hope this helps you to extract data from large text files.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/text-editing-split-or-combine-multiple-lines/"/>
    <updated>2017-10-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/text-editing-split-or-combine-multiple-lines</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a developer, I often end up needing to manipulate text. Sometimes this text can get quite large, and it might take a while to do it manually. If you have a text editor under your <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">tool belt</a>, it often helps in situations like that. Let&rsquo;s looks at one of the common scenarios that I come across and how we can solve that using a text editor. I use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> as my go-to editor for such text editing hacks, but you can do this in any text editor that supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_editing">simultaneous editing</a>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I just get a list of comma separated values and need to insert double (or single) quotes around each value to use in a SQL query. To demonstrate this, I ended up going to <a href="https://www.random.org/integers/">random.org</a> to generate a list of random values and had to use the same technique that I was to demonstrate as in the SQL query case. I generated 12 random numbers, and the site gave a tab separated list of values, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="text">91    66    31    11    90
80    1    24    48    61
61    66
</code></pre>

<p>I now need to convert this into a comma-separated list. Let&rsquo;s see how we can go about doing this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the recurring character pattern. In this case, it is the tab space.</li>
<li>Select all occurrences of the pattern. (Alt + F3 - Find All in Sublime)</li>
<li>Act on all the occurrences. In this case, I want to remove them, so I use <em>Del</em></li>
<li>Since I want to introduce a comma between each of the numbers, I first split them into multiple lines using <em>Enter</em>. Now I have all the numbers on a separate line.</li>
<li>Select all the numbers and insert a cursor at the end of each. ( Ctrl + Shift + L)</li>
<li>Insert comma. We still have the cursor at the end of all lines, so just pressing <em>Delete</em> again combines all the lines into one. Remove the trailing comma.</li>
</ol>


<div style="text-align: center;">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nDDWviJ5xHM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<p>Though this is a specific example, I hope you get the general idea on how to go about manipulating text, to split and combine as required. I hope you will be able to insert double (or single) quotes around each value in the comma separated values that we have now, to use in a SQL query!</p>
