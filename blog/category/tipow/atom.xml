<p>-<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/"><em>Jeff Atwood</em></a></p></blockquote>

<p>If you are like me, spending a lot of time with a computer, it&rsquo;s worth you take the time to learn to type without looking at the keyboard a.k.a touch typing (if you currently type by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing#Hunt_and_peck">hunt and peck method</a>). Though productivity cannot be measured by the number of words you type per minute, it&rsquo;s good to learn to touch type. There are various applications that help you to improve your typing speed. Some of them are online and some offline desktop applications. Pick one that suits you and improve your typing speed.</p>

<p>I learned to touch type only a couple of years back,  getting inspired after reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2hmblsw">Learn Anything in 20  Hours</a>. In the book, the author explains how he learned a new keyboard layout, Colemak, in just 20 hours.  The book explains the full process and setup used by the author. It uses various tools like <a href="https://wwwtyro.github.io/keyzen/">Keyzen</a>, <a href="http://type-fu.com/">Type-fu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/webiest/amphetype">Amphetype</a>. More than the tools it is the process and the approach to the learning that is interesting. A <a href="https://first20hours.com/typing/">summary of the tools and approaches</a> is available here but highly recommend reading the book. I found the approach very helpful and effective and used to learn QWERTY layout.</p>

<p>Irrespective of the way you choose to learn touch typing, it might seem a bit hard at the start. Keep at it for some time snd you will soon see an improvement in your typing speed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you own a website, then it is good to check their performance now and then. Various factors affect the site speed, and it&rsquo;s better to use some tools to do the job for you.</p>

<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/">Google PageSpeed</a> is a set of tools from Google designed to check and optimize websites performance. PageSpeed Insights is one of the tools in the suite that helps identify the ways to make your site faster and mobile friendly. The tools check for common good practices and provide a score out of 100 points. <em>PageSpeed Insights only considers the network-independent aspects of page performance: the server configuration, the HTML structure of a page, and its use of external resources such as images, JavaScript, and CSS.</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/PageInsights.png" alt="PageInsights" class="center" ></p>

<p><a href="http://yslow.org/">YSlow</a> is a similar tool from Yahoo!, that analyzes web pages for performance. It is available as a browser extension and has one for all popular ones. It provides a grade for the web page based on a predefined ruleset or a user-defined ruleset. The grade is calculated based on the <a href="http://yslow.org/ruleset-matrix/">YSlow Ruleset Matrix</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/yslow.png" alt="YSlow" class="center" ></p>

<p>I have been implementing some of the recommendations from the above tools on this blog, but as you can see from the above results, there is still more to be done. Hope you find this helpful for your sites.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/chocolatey-install-softwares-with-ease/"/>
    <updated>2017-08-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/chocolatey-install-softwares-with-ease</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/chocolatey.png" alt="Chocolatey - Package Manager for Windows" class="center" ></p>

<p><a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> is a package manager for Windows. Chocolatey is a central store of applications, tools, and other packages. It allows you to install them on your computer from the command line. Let’s look at an example to make things more clear. Let’s say I want to install the Google Chrome Browser on my system. Below is how I would go about installing it.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Installing Google Chrome (Without Chocolatey)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Bing for Google Chrome (Assuming that you are on Windows and open up Internet Explorer and search for Google Chrome)</li>
<li>Click the relevant link from the Search Results</li>
<li>Hit the Download Chrome button</li>
<li>Wait for the installer to download and open that to install.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Installing Google Chrome (With Chocolatey)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Run &lsquo;<em>choco install googlechrome</em>&rsquo; from command line</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Installing with Chocolatey is quick and easy. You no longer need to go around searching the web for the software that you want to install. If you are unsure of the package name (e.g. googlechrome), you can search the entire packages library. This is possible from the command line using &lsquo;<em>choco search</em>.&rsquo; Or you can also search on their <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages">website</a>.</p>

<p>Run the below script from the command line to <a href="https://chocolatey.org/install">install Chocolatey Package Manager</a>. Once installed you can start managing applications through the command line using Chocolatey.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" &amp;&amp; SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
</code></pre>

<p>Other than installing and searching packages, Chocolatey also supports a lot of other commands to manage applications including un-installation. The entire commands supported are available <a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/commandslist">here</a>. Instead, you can get the details in your command line using &lsquo;<em>choco -h</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hope that helps you save some time when you next want to install something.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/testing-your-website-under-different-bandwidths/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/testing-your-website-under-different-bandwidths</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the blazing fast internet speeds at work (and at home) it might be hard to imagine how sites would work for people with a lower bandwidth. When developing for the Web, it is good to keep in mind that people from various regions across the globe might access your site. Internet speeds are not that fast around the world. So it is essential to test how your website performs for people on a lower bandwidth.</p>

<p>There are a lot of plugins and external tools that can simulate a lower bandwidth scenario and makes testing on slower bandwidth easier. If you are using Google Chrome, then you already have one such tool under your belt. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/reference#throttling">Network tab</a> under Google Chrome Developer Tools has an option to set different bandwidth profiles. Setting this to a profile that you want, and launching the site forces the site load on the set bandwidth.</p>

<p><img src="/images/chrome_network_delay.png" alt="Google Chrome Developer Tools - Network Delay" class="center" /></p>

<p>There are many default bandwidth profiles in there, and it also allows you to add custom profiles if required. There is also an option to simulate offline mode, to test how the application behaves without an internet connection (if that applies to you). However such testing is mostly restricted to manual testing, and for automating this, you might have to look for external tools.</p>

<p>Hope this helps optimize your site for lower bandwidth!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/hemingway-editor/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/hemingway-editor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time. Remember this in moments of despair. If you find that writing is hard, it&rsquo;s because it is hard.</em></p>

<p>&ndash; William Zinsser, On Writing Well</p></blockquote>

<p>Editing is the hardest part of writing and one that I skip the most. I try hard not to skip editing, but often I end up being lazy to do the hard work. I try to cover this up with some tools to make it faster. It is hard for one tool to get it all right. So it&rsquo;s best if you have a range of tools under your belt to support you with writing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">The Hemingway Editor</a> highlights hard to read sentences, adverbs, complicated phrases, etc. The writing app uses different colors to highlight the various issues as shown below. The editor also shows a summary of the text including the reading time, total words, sentences etc. The app also shows a <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/help.html">Readability Grade</a> using Automated Readability Index.</p>

<p><img src="/images/hemingway.png" alt="Hemingway Editor"></p>

<p>The Hemingway Editor is available for free on the web with lesser features. The web application does not let you save your work. You are always at risk of loosing the work if you are authoring on the site.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/desktop.html">Windows/Mac applications</a> supports a larger set of features but for a price. The desktop application works without an internet connection, allows publishing to Wordpress/Medium. It also supports to exporting to different formats (word, pdf, html, markdown etc.).</p>

<p>I use the Hemingway Editor (on the web) occasionally and find it useful at times. It&rsquo;s good to double check for any issues before publishing the post. Hope this helps you as well in your writing.</p>
