    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Merging conflicts can be a pain when working in large teams and code bases change fast. Every time you sync with the main code base you need to make sure that you integrate the updates with your work in progress. It&rsquo;s great when the changes get automatically merged by the source control systems. But when things need to be manually merged is where a good tool can be of help.</p>

<p><img src="/images/beyond_compare.png" class="center" alt="Beyond Compare"></p>

<blockquote><p><em><a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/index.php">Beyond Compare</a> allows you to quickly and easily compare your files and folders.  By using simple, powerful commands, you can focus on the differences you&rsquo;re interested in and ignore those you&rsquo;re not.  You can then merge the changes, synchronize your files, and generate reports for your records.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/features.php?zz=features_multifaceted">Text Compare</a> viewer is the one that I use most frequently to compare or merge different versions of code. Beyond Compare makes it easy to spot the code differences and gives the capability to copy the code from one version to another. One can also copy portions of changes and merge just that instead of all the changes. The 3-Way Text Merge feature is also useful, especially when you are using Git.</p>

<p>Beyond Compare has a Standard and a Pro Edition with a lot of <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/features.php?zz=features_list">features</a>. I have the Pro Edition license for Beyond Compare, thanks to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">Readify</a> for the Software allowance that you get every year.</p>

<p>Beyond Compare is one of the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">tools that I use almost daily</a>. Check it out if you have not already.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/fiddler-free-web-debugging-proxy/"/>
    <updated>2017-06-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/fiddler-free-web-debugging-proxy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> is an HTTP debugging proxy server application and captures HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It is one of the tools in my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">essential toolkit list</a>. Fiddler allows debugging traffic from PC, MAC, Linux and mobile systems. It helps inspect the raw requests and responses between the client and the server.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fiddler_inspectors.png" alt="Fiddler" class="center" ></p>

<p>Some of the key features that I often use in Fiddler are</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/Observe-Traffic/Tasks/ViewSessionContent">Inspect Request/Response</a>
Look into the request and response data to see if all the required headers/attributes are set, and the data is sent as expected</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/using-fiddler-to-help-in-manual-testing/">Compose Web Requests</a>
Manually compose requests to send to server and test endpoints.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/simulating-delays-in-http-calls-for-manual-tests/">AutoRespond to Requests</a>
Intercept requests from the browser and send back a pre-defined response or create a delay in response to the actual client.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/Observe-Traffic/Tasks/ViewSessionStatistics">Statistics</a>
Fiddler statistics give an overview of the performance details of a web session, indicating where the time is spent in the whole request/response cycle.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/Generate-Traffic/Tasks/ResendRequest">Modify and Replay a Request</a>
Fiddler allows modifying the request by editing its contents and replay the message to the server.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/Save-And-Load-Traffic/Tasks/CreateSAZ">Export and Import</a>
Fiddler makes it easy to share captured traces with different people. All captured traffic or selected requests can be exported and shared with others. The exported saz file can be opened in Fiddler to view back all the session details.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These are some of the features that I use on a regular basis. Fiddler supports a lot more and is extensible to support custom requirements as well. I find it an indispensable tool when developing for the Web. <a href="https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler">Get Fiddler</a> if you have not already.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/using-git-locally-in-a-tfvc-repository/"/>
    <updated>2017-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/using-git-locally-in-a-tfvc-repository</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The project that I am currently working on using <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/tfvc/overview">Team Foundation Version Control</a>(TFVC) as it&rsquo;s source control. After <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/git-checkout-tfs/">using Git</a> for a long time it felt hard to move back to TFVC. One of the biggest pain for me is losing the short commits that I do when working. Short commits help keep track of the work and also quickly revert unwanted changes. Branching is also much easier with Git and allows to switch between work without much hassle of &lsquo;<em>shelving -> undoing -> pulling back the latest as with TFS.</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p><img src="/images/tfvc_local_git.png" alt="Use Git Locally in a TFVC Repository" class="center" /></p>

<p>The best part with git is that you can use it to work with any folder in your system and does not need any setup. By just running &lsquo;<em><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init">git init</a></em>&rsquo; it initializes a git repository in the folder. Running <em>init</em> against my local TFVC source code folder, I initialized a git repository locally. Now it allows me to work locally using git - make commits, revert, change branches, etc. Whenever I reach a logical end to the work, I create a shelveset and push the changes up the TFVC source control from Visual Studio.</p>

<p>If you want to interact with the TFVC source control straight from the command line, you can try out <a href="https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs">git-tfs</a> - a Git/TFS bridge. For me, since I am happy working locally with git and pushing up the finished work as shelvesets from Visual Studio I have not explored the git-tfs tool.</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone if you feel stuck with TFVC repositories!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/spigen-awesome-phone-cases/"/>
    <updated>2017-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/spigen-awesome-phone-cases</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are looking to get a case for your phone, then check out cases by <a href="https://www.spigen.com/">Spigen</a>. I have been using Spigen cases for over three years, and I totally recommend it.</p>

<p>Spigen cases are made with premium materials and are slim, sleek and simple. Spigen provides various models that match different needs. The cases provide <a href="https://www.spigen.com/pages/military-grade">Military Grade Protection</a> and protect the phone from most falls.</p>

<p>The first Spigen cases I got was for my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/">Nexus 5</a>. The Neo Hybrid lasted for over three years. With the Spigen cases, the Nexus was well protected. It did fall from my hands many times, and every time the case protected it well enough. A couple of months back the Spigen case broke, and I had been using the phone without a cover since then. Unfortunately, during one of my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/three_months_to_a_half_marathon/">morning runs</a> the phone fell from my hands while slipping it into the armband. Without the Spigen to protect it, the Nexus screen broke at the corners.</p>

<p><img src="/images/spigen_pixel.png" alt="Spigen Neo Hybrid for Pixel" class="center" /></p>

<p>A month back I switched over to Google Pixel as the Nexus was becoming unusable with the broken screen. I got the <a href="https://www.spigen.com/collections/pixel/products/google-pixel-case-neo-hybrid?variant=29248762049">Spigen NeoHybrid for Pixel</a>. The case provides dual layer protection with TCU and PC bumper and comes with fingerprint resistance. The precise cutouts give easy access to all buttons and fingerprint sensor.</p>

<p>If you are looking to a get a case, check out if <a href="https://www.spigen.com/">Spigen</a> has one for your model!</p>
