    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At times you might need to extract data from a large text. Let&rsquo;s say you have a JSON response, and you want to extract all the <em>id</em> fields in the response and <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/text-editing-split-or-combine-multiple-lines/">combine them as comma separated</a>. Here&rsquo;s how you can easily extract data from large text using Sublime (or any other text editor that supports simultaneous editing).</p>

<pre><code class="json https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts">[
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
    "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto"
  },
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 2,
    "title": "qui est esse",
    "body": "est rerum tempore vitae\nsequi sint nihil reprehenderit dolor beatae ea dolores neque\nfugiat blanditiis voluptate porro vel nihil molestiae ut reiciendis\nqui aperiam non debitis possimus qui neque nisi nulla"
  },
  ...
]
</code></pre>

<p>Again the key here is to select the recurring pattern first. In this case, it is <em>&ldquo;id&rdquo;:</em> and then selecting all occurrences of that. Once all occurrences are selected, we can select the whole line and extract that out. Repeat the same to remove the <em>id</em> text. Then follow the same steps we used to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/text-editing-split-or-combine-multiple-lines/">combine text</a>.</p>

<p>Hope this helps you to extract data from large text files.</p>

    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/text-editing-split-or-combine-multiple-lines</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a developer, I often end up needing to manipulate text. Sometimes this text can get quite large, and it might take a while to do it manually. If you have a text editor under your <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">tool belt</a>, it often helps in situations like that. Let&rsquo;s looks at one of the common scenarios that I come across and how we can solve that using a text editor. I use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> as my go-to editor for such text editing hacks, but you can do this in any text editor that supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_editing">simultaneous editing</a>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I just get a list of comma separated values and need to insert double (or single) quotes around each value to use in a SQL query. To demonstrate this, I ended up going to <a href="https://www.random.org/integers/">random.org</a> to generate a list of random values and had to use the same technique that I was to demonstrate as in the SQL query case. I generated 12 random numbers, and the site gave a tab separated list of values, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="text">91    66    31    11    90
80    1    24    48    61
61    66
</code></pre>

<p>I now need to convert this into a comma-separated list. Let&rsquo;s see how we can go about doing this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the recurring character pattern. In this case, it is the tab space.</li>
<li>Select all occurrences of the pattern. (Alt + F3 - Find All in Sublime)</li>
<li>Act on all the occurrences. In this case, I want to remove them, so I use <em>Del</em></li>
<li>Since I want to introduce a comma between each of the numbers, I first split them into multiple lines using <em>Enter</em>. Now I have all the numbers on a separate line.</li>
<li>Select all the numbers and insert a cursor at the end of each. ( Ctrl + Shift + L)</li>
<li>Insert comma. We still have the cursor at the end of all lines, so just pressing <em>Delete</em> again combines all the lines into one. Remove the trailing comma.</li>
</ol>


<div style="text-align: center;">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nDDWviJ5xHM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<p>Though this is a specific example, I hope you get the general idea on how to go about manipulating text, to split and combine as required. I hope you will be able to insert double (or single) quotes around each value in the comma separated values that we have now, to use in a SQL query!</p>

    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/electronically-sign-pdf-no-more-printing-and-scanning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Very often I need to sign forms, receipts, invoices in PDF format and send them across to someone else. Printing the PDF, signing them physically and scanning them back (of course using <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/office-lens-scan-documents-with-your-phone/">Office Lens</a>) is how I used to do this until a while back. Since I don&rsquo;t have a printer at home, I always had to wait till I reach office. Also, I did not like wasting paper and ink just to put a signature.</p>

<p>Adobe PDF reader allows us to &lsquo;Fill and Sign&rsquo; documents. Using this option we can add signatures without needing to print them. Follow the below steps to set up your Adobe Reader to sign any document.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Sign on a white paper and take a picture. Upload the picture onto your computer and crop the image using your favorite <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/paint-dot-net/">image editor</a>. You should have something similar as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pdf_signature.png" alt="Your Signature" class="center" /></p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Open the PDF file that you need to sign with <a href="https://get.adobe.com/reader/">Adobe Reader</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Open &lsquo;Fill and Sign&rsquo; option. You can do this either from the &lsquo;Tools Pane&rsquo; (Shift + F4 on windows) or the menu &lsquo;View -> Tools -> Fill and Sign.&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Under the Sign option, you can choose a signature image. Choose the image you created before and save.</p>

<p><img src="/images/adobe_add_sign.png" alt="Add your Signature" class="center" /></p>

<p>You are all set to sign documents now. Anytime you want to sign a document, choose &lsquo;Fill and Sign&rsquo; and you will see your signature under the Sign button. Click the signature and place it anywhere on the document that you want to sign. No more printing and scanning them back again.</p>

    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/office-lens-scan-documents-with-your-phone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scanning physical documents can be cumbersome using a scanner, especially if you do not have easy access to one. Taking pictures with the default camera application on the phone might not give the best of results that you are expecting. Also, you will mostly end up needing to trim such photos of unwanted elements.</p>

<p>Microsoft Office Lens is the perfect application for scanning documents and whiteboards. Office Lens focuses documents in the camera frame and allows you to capture just what is required. It enhances the selected document sections. Below is an example of the highlight and the captured document.</p>

<li>Make digital copies of your printed documents, business cards or posters, and trim them precisely.</li>
<li>Printed text will be automatically recognized (using OCR) by converting Word and PDF, so you can search for words in images and copy and edit them.</li>
</ul>


<p>Office Lens is available on all platforms. Download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officelens&amp;hl=en">Android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/office-lens/id975925059?mt=8">iOS</a> or the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/store/p/office-lens/9wzdncrfj3t8">Windows</a> version from the stores.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/headphone_rule.png" class="center" alt="The Headphones Rule" ></p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>I need some undistracted time</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This was one of the things that came up in my team&rsquo;s retrospective yesterday. Having some undistracted time is necessary for getting things done. It&rsquo;s a good practice to have a consensus among the team members on how to manage disruptions and indicate whether you are open for a chat.</p>

<p><a href="http://theheadphonesrule.com/">The Headphone Rule</a> is an interesting way to indicate whether a person is open to interactions or not.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>no headphones, you can talk to me.</em></p>

<p><em>1 headphone, you can talk to me about work</em></p>

<p><em>2 headphones, do not talk to me.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>For people who do not use a headphone, some other technique needs to be used (like sticky notes, colored lights, etc.). Luckily in my team, everyone uses headphones, and it was an acceptable solution. Irrespective of the way you choose it is important to have some agreed way to indicate whether you are interruptible or not. It helps you and the team to have some undistracted time.</p>
