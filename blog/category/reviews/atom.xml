    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Day in and day out, knowingly or unknowingly we get to use http. While accessing a web site, even the current one that you are reading, you are using http. Http is an application protocol that forms the basis of data communication for the web. As an end user of web pages, it is not necessary to be aware of the protocol, but as developers we ought to know in detail about the protocol and its possibilities.</p>

<p>You could find in detail about the entire protocol spec, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">here</a>.  If you have already gone through it in its entirety then this blog might be of very little or no help at all. For the others, who I suppose majority of us would be this is just about pointing you to another resource that would take hardly a couple of hours of your time, to get enough information on the protocol.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/http_succinctly.png"  alt="http succinctly" /></p>

<p>With all the concise and precise information , <strong><a href="http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks?UTM_medium=rahulblogreview">Syncfusion’s Succinctly series</a></strong> has a very good resource covering <a href="http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/http?UTM_medium=rahulblogreview"><strong>HTTP</strong></a>.  As the name, succinctly suggests, this book series gives you enough information that enables you to master a wide range of topics.  All you need to do is to fill up a contact form and get access to all the books in kindle and pdf format, all for free.  As a company this is a a very good contribution that Syncfusion is making to the community giving away all these resources for free.</p>

<p>The HTTP Succinctly book is written by <a href="http://odetocode.com/">Scott Allen</a> and it covers Resources, Messages, Connections, Web Architecture, State and Security.</p>

<p>The book details on the url format , encoding and various media types and how they are served when a request is made. It expands on the request , response  messages and and different response status codes.  Scott goes on to explain on how http uses the underlying tcp protocol, to transfer messages across the network and how browsers open parallel connections to speed up the way web sites are delivered to us.  If it was not for proxies and caching the web would not be as scalable as it is today. The protocol would not be complete without mentioning about these and so does this one.  Http being a stateless protocol, maintaining state is a very important thing for developers to provide a good experience to the users. The book touches on cookies, its uses, types and downsides. The book closes on discussing about security and different modes of authentication.
The HTTP Succinctly discusses on all the important topics of the protocol required to us as developers, and I would strongly urge any web developer to read through this 55 pages of concise and precise information. Having such books takes away the need for searching through the web and figuring out all related articles and blog posts to get the required information.  Hope to see more books getting added into this series of books.</p>

    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/what-made-me-choose-vanguard-up-rise-45</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Deciding on a dslr was not so tough a year back, it was either Canon or Nikon and it just happened that i chose Canon since in the beginner level series neither seemed to make a difference, at least for me. I have a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-550D-Digital-Camera-Body/dp/B0037KM0EY">Canon 550d</a> with a set of beginner level lenses (a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-S-18-55mm-3-5-5-6-II/dp/B000V5K3FG/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357390070&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=canon+18-55">18-55mm</a> kit lens, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-Camera-Lens/dp/B00007E7JU/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357390018&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=canon+50mm+1.8">50mm</a> prime and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-55-250mm-4-0-5-6-Telephoto-Digital/dp/B0011NVMO8">55-250mm</a> telephoto zoom) and a tripod(1.3 kg ,folded height 460mm).
For over an year I was using the bag that came with my dslr and decided now to upgrade to a better one, as I found it difficult to carry around the camera, lenses and tripod. I was looking for a backpack model and with lots of brands out there choosing one was really a tough thing. At first I did want to have a bag that could take a laptop too, but then decided against it as all those bags that could take a laptop tend to be a bit bulky. Carrying a laptop would be only while I travel and not when I go out for shooting, so then decided against one with a laptop. After some online research I shortlisted a couple of bags.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://products.lowepro.com/product/flipside-300,2083.htm">Lowepro Flipside 300</a></li>
<li><a href="http://products.lowepro.com/product/DSLR-Video%20Fastpack%20250%20AW,2282.htm">Lowepro Video Fastpack 250aw</a></li>
<li><a href="http://products.lowepro.com/product/Pro-Runner-200-AW,2181,14.htm">Lowepro Pro Runner 200AW</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.manfrotto.com/product/0/MB%2BSB390-3BC/_/Veloce_III_Camera_Backpack_for_DSLR_(Bungee_Cord)">Manfrotto Veloce III</a></li>
</ol>


<p>Deciding to drop into a store to see them was the best thing that I did, and I suggest everyone planning to buy a dslr bag to do that. What’s good for me, might not work out for you. Except the flipside one I did see everything else. For me the fastpack 250aw was a bit bulky, the Pro Runner a bit too small and lacking a quick access entry. Manfrotto was decent enough but then my tripod would not go through the tripod strap, since my tripod has all its legs connected to the centre rod.
I happened to see the Vanguard Up-rise 43, which was actually a sling bag but had all the other features I was looking for. It was sleek looking, well padded,had a tripod holder(now this one had a adjustable strap to hold the tripod), a quick access,rain cover.
Back home I did again a bit of research and got to see the Up-rise 45,46 and 48, which is the backpack bags in the up-rise series . Now that was what exactly I was looking for. 48 was way too big for me. Now had to choose between the 46 and 45 the only difference being the former could take a laptop too,and was not that bulky too. Also the models are also different. For Up-rise 46 the bag opening was from the <a href="http://www.premier-ink.co.uk/images/images_big/vg_uprise46_1.jpg">front</a> and for Up-rise 45 the opening was from the <a href="http://img2.blogs.yahoo.co.jp/ybi/1/7a/03/shira_gon/folder/1199363/img_1199363_32950708_2?1268142426">back</a>. The Up-rise 46 had just one problem of having the tripod strap on the opening bag flap, having you to untie the tripod first(if you have used that to tie the tripod. This one also does have a elastic band to the middle of the bag through which you can slide your tripod in, as in manfrotto. But then my tripod had to tied using the strap due to the same problem mentioned above).
So finally I had a choice, <a href="http://www.vanguardworld.com/index.php/en/pv/products/detail-1-1-4-33.html">Vanguard Up-Rise 45</a>, at least for now that I feel might be good for me. Just got it shipped today and planning to take it with me for the next trip.
Below are some snaps of the my bag. I did find a good <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A4GN5lJhQY">video</a> on youtube which shows all the features, so I didn’t want to do one again.</p>
