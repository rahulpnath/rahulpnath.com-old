    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>If you have decided on <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/checking-in-package-dependencies-into-source-control/">Checking in Package Dependencies into Source Control</a> for an existing project that uses Nuget Packages then this post is for you</em></p>

<p>When using NuGet package references that are not included in the source control, these packages gets restored during build time. There are <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore">multiple ways that NuGet supports restore these dependencies at build time</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Automatic Package Restore is the current recommended approach (within Visual Studio), which is available from NuGet 2.7.</li>
<li>Command-line package restore on build servers</li>
<li>MSBuild-integrated package restore approach is the original Package Restore implementation and is still used in many projects.</li>
</ul>


<p>Depending on the type to of restore the project uses, NuGet has different configuration entries in the <em>csproj</em> files and <em>.nuget</em> folder in the solution root. So when choosing to check in package dependencies into the source control, it is a good idea to remove all these <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore/migrating-to-automatic-package-restore">generated configurations</a> and files that are not required any more. The below script does this for you!</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>WARNING!</strong> The script deletes the <em>.nuget</em> folder (if it exists), updates the <em>.csproj</em> files. Please make sure that the project folder is under source control or you have a backup of the folder. After running the script make sure that all the changes that you see are expected as explained here and the project builds and runs as before.
</div>


<p>The PowerShell script does the below for a given solution directory folder (mandatory)</p>

<ul>
<li>For each of the <em>csproj</em> file in the given folder, the script removes the

<ul>
<li><em>RestorePackages</em> node</li>
<li><em>NugetPackageImportStamp</em> node</li>
<li><em>nuget target import</em> from the solution root .nuget folder</li>
<li><em>EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports</em> node</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removes <em>.nuget</em> folder from the solution root if it exists.</li>
</ul>


<p><em>The script leaves blank lines in the </em>csproj<em> files in place of the removed nodes.</em></p>

<pre><code class="powershell Remove NuGet Restore https://gist.github.com/rahulpnath/13d3b4f54cec51e22344876b1566b911#file-remove-nuget-restore-ps1">param([Parameter(Mandatory=$true)][string]$solutionDirectory) 

 $importNugetTargetsTag= [regex]::escape(@'
&lt;Import Project="$(SolutionDir)\.nuget\NuGet.targets" Condition="Exists('$(SolutionDir)\.nuget\NuGet.targets')" /&gt;
'@)

$restorePackagesTag = '&lt;RestorePackages&gt;.*?&lt;/RestorePackages&gt;'
$nuGetPackageImportStamp = '&lt;NuGetPackageImportStamp&gt;.*?&lt;/NuGetPackageImportStamp&gt;'

$EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImportsTargetTag = '(?smi)&lt;Target Name="EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports".*?&lt;/Target&gt;'

foreach ($f in Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path $solutionDirectory -Filter *.csproj | sort-object)
{
    $text = Get-Content $f.FullName -Raw
    $text `
        -replace $importNugetTargetsTag, "" `
        -replace $nuGetPackageImportStamp, "" `
        -replace $restorePackagesTag, "" `
        -replace $EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImportsTargetTag, "" `
        | set-content $f.FullName
}

Get-ChildItem -Path $solutionDirectory -include .nuget -Recurse | foreach ($_) { remove-item $_.fullname -Force -Recurse }
</code></pre>

<p>Any similarity with the scripts <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jongalloway/scripting-net-project-migration-to-automatic-nuget-package-restore">here</a> is intended as that was my starting place. To explicitly <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore#opting-out">opt out of the Automatic Package Restore</a> on Visual Studio add a <em>Nuget.config</em> in the solution root.
&#8220;` xml
&lt;?xml version=&ldquo;1.0&rdquo; encoding=&ldquo;utf-8&rdquo;?>
<configuration>
  <packageRestore>
    <!-- Opts out of both Automatic Package Restore and MSBuild-Integrated Package Restore -->
    <add key="enabled" value="False" /></p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- Opts out of Automatic Package Restore in Visual Studio --&gt;
&lt;add key="automatic" value="False" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  </packageRestore>
</configuration>
&#8220;`</p>

<p>Hope this helps you to move away from NuGet restore at build time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post looks into why we should include packages in the source control and not resolve it via configuration files at build time.</em></p>

<p>Over the past few years, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">Package Managers</a> have gained an important role in the way software gets developed. There is an <a href="https://github.com/showcases/package-managers">increasing number of package managers</a> catering to different programming languages and areas of development, making the distribution of reusable libraries and plugins easy. The convention that&rsquo;s usually followed with these package dependencies is to exclude them from source control, and use a configuration file (<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json">package.json</a>, <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore">packages.config</a>) to retrieve all the packages at build time. Even the <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">GitHub’s collection</a> of <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore">.gitignore</a> file templates ignores the packages folders of various package managers.</p>

<h3>Common Arguments for not Checking in Packages</h3>

<p>Since checking in packages is not a common practice, let&rsquo;s first see some of the arguments for not doing this and how it compares to having them checked in.</p>

<h4><strong>Storage</strong></h4>

<p><em>Packages are something that can be resolved at runtime and keeping them excluded saves that extra space on the source control system.</em></p>

<p>Yes, this might have been a good reason few years back, but these days this is not a good reason as storage has become really cheap. Moreover popular source control systems charge by the <a href="https://github.com/pricing/plans">number of repositories</a> and not by the space it occupies (although it has <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/">limits</a> on it).</p>

<h4><strong>Time</strong></h4>

<p><em>The clone is faster when you do not have packages in the source control repository as opposed to having them.</em></p>

<p>But for the project to build we need the packages restored first. So the time is either spent in the clone or in the restore. But if the packages are included in the git clone then you can immediately start working on the project after a clone and do not need any internet connectivity to make the project build. This is also of advantage if you want to run a &lsquo;<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean">git clean</a>&rsquo; - which cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control. With packages not under the source control, you have to restore them every time you run it - This is not a problem if you have internet connectivity, but will block your work if you do it when you don&rsquo;t.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Without checking in dependent packages, you can&rsquo;t git clone and get on a flight nor can you git clean while on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane_mode">flight</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover cloning a repository is a one-time activity, while a clean can be done any time a developer wants to. So it actually saves more time to keep the packages checked in.</p>

<h3>More Reason for Checking in Packages</h3>

<p>Now that we have seen most of the common arguments are not valid, let&rsquo;s see more reasons on why including the packages into the source control is actually better.</p>

<h4><strong>Explicit Dependencies</strong></h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s always better to be explicit about your code dependencies and not have them resolved by a package manager.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Packages are nothing but code and can alter the behaviour of the application.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>There are possibilities of specific package versions getting <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm">removed from the package manager</a>, which your application is still dependent on and leads to build breakage! If your package configuration is set up in such a way to resolve the latest available package of  the specific dependency, there are possibilities that the package owner pushes an update that is not backward compatible, causing the build to break! Given that these possibilities exist there is no reason to exclude package dependencies from checked in.</p>

<h4><strong>Package Source Downtime</strong></h4>

<p>Though the publicly available package sources like NuGet, npm are available almost all the time, it is likely that they too <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17806889/nuget-feed-reliability">can go down</a>. The last thing you would want is to get blocked by the downtime of these services - be it failure to build locally or on a server or even block a critical deployment. With the packages available in your source control, you have one less moving part in your whole deployment pipeline and it is better to have lesser dependencies.</p>

<h4><strong>Custom Package Sources</strong></h4>

<p>Many times I have had to update my Package sources in Visual Studio and break my head on the specific order of these entries to get the project building. This is very common when using custom packages sources like <a href="http://inedo.com/proget">ProGet</a> or <a href="https://myget.org/">MyGet</a>. Such dependencies make project setup harder and is easily avoided if all the dependent assemblies are available within the repository.  You can still have them as custom NuGet sources but have the dependencies included into the repository and update the references whenever source changes. This makes project ramp up easier and faster, with one less configuration step.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Nuget custom package source" src="/images/nuget_package_sources.png" /></p>

<p>Do you still see any reason for not checking in package dependencies into the source control? If not let&rsquo;s go and change that package folder exclude and have them included in the source. (I just updated <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/clal-command-line-application-launcher/">CLAL</a> to <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/clal/commit/736023d9ab4bd285cb077ff54acd1bbaad142a08">include dependencies.</a>)</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/git-checkout-tfs/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-15T05:23:08+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/git-checkout-tfs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a year since using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> as my mainstream version control system and I am loving it! Before Git, I had used Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) for a very long time and was so used to it that I found Git a bit complex and overwhelming in the beginning. Team Foundation Server (TFS) is the whole product suite from Microsoft that provides source code management. Until TFS 2013, it supported only TFVC which is when it introduced <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mvpawardprogram/2013/11/13/git-for-tfs-2013/">Git in TFS</a>. Even today people use TFS and TFVC synonymously (like in the title of this post) though they are not the same.</p>

<h3>Fundamental shift in thinking</h3>

<p>By design, Git is a Distributed VCS, whereas TFS is centralized one. It takes quite a while to get your head around this and what it actually means. By definition</p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong>TFVC</strong>: Uses a single, centralized server repository to track and version files. Local changes are always checked in to the central server where other developers can get the latest changes.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Git</strong>: Git is a distributed version control system. Each developer has a copy of the source repository on their dev machine. Developers can commit each set of changes on their dev machine and perform version control operations such as history and compare without a network connection.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>You. may not see the real Distributed benefits if you are working off a central repository (hosted on a server like GitHub or Bitbucket) and using <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow">TFS way of development</a> :</p>

<p><em>Get latest code => Make your changes => Merge latest +> Check in (</em>Commit and push<em>)</em></p>

<p>The real power of Git is better understood when you start working disconnected, use branches to keep unrelated development activities separate and merge those into the main trunk (<em>master</em>) once comfortable. You get a local copy of the project and lets you make changes independent of all the other changes in the project.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Git feels so lightweight and never gets in the way of doing things.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Make command line your friend</h3>

<p>If you are a UI savvy person then Git might a good starting point to start using the command line. At first, it definitely feels hard especially if you were TFS/Visual Studio users and might be tempted to use the GUI tools available (<a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> or <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Repetitive tasks become more evident when you use a command line and easily automatable.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I use Cmder (<a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">one of my favourite tools</a>) with Git and have <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/">set up SSH</a> to Bitbucket and Github (expected soon on TFS), secured by a paraphrase, so that I do not have to key in the credentials every time I interact with the repositories. I <a href="https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/193#issuecomment-63040989">start the ssh-agent the very first time I open Cmder</a>, which prompts for my paraphrase and continues to run in the background. Alternatively, you can also use <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows">Credential Manager</a> to store credentials, when working with HTTP enabled Git repository. For the common commands, I have set up aliases like below, to save a bit on the keystrokes.</p>

<pre><code class="text">gl=git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate  $*
gs=git status
ga=git add -A 
gp=git pull
gpp=git push 
gc=git commit -m "$*"  
gcc=git commit
</code></pre>

<h3>Different workflows</h3>

<p>Git can be used in many ways and which makes it hard to get started. There are a few popular <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/">workflows</a> that one can use. Currently, I am using -  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow">Feature Branch workflow</a> -
which means that all work happen on independent feature branches and once completed gets merged into the main trunk (master branch). Code Reviews happens on the way it gets pulled into the main branch, which ensures code quality and familiarity.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow/01.svg"><img class="center" alt="Git Feature Branch Workflow" src="/images/git_featurebranch_workflow.png" /></a></p>

<h3>Not Just for Code</h3>

<p>Git is a version control system and does not limit itself to storing code. You can use it for <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/11/08/seven-ways-to-use-github-that-arent-coding/">version controlling any of your work</a>. For example, this blog is <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/rahulpnath.com">hosted on Github</a> and all the <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/rahulpnath.com/commits/master">changes are version controlled</a>, which gives me the flexibility to work and commit locally. Since the blog is <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/static-generator-is-all-a-blog-needs-moving-to-octopress/">static generated</a> I can also preview all the changes locally. I use git whenever I work on any documents or <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Speaking">presentations</a> so that I can avoid manual copy of files and renaming with suffixes like &lsquo;<em>Draft</em>, &rsquo;<em>Draft1</em>,<em>Final</em>,&ldquo;<em>FinalRevision</em>&lsquo; etc. (if that sounds any similar)</p>

<h3>Managing Commits</h3>

<p>When coming to commits, which are nothing but checkpoints of meaningful work done, people might have a different  definition for &lsquo;<em>meaningful</em>&rsquo; - for some it might be really granular, for others a bit coarse and for yet another it means all the work is done. I tend to commit quite often - even a rename of a variable leads to a commit so that I do not have to backtrack if at all something goes wrong immediately after that.</p>

<p>if you really like the idea of committing often (locally), but want the pushes to remotes more coarse, you can &lsquo;<strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git">squash your commits</a></strong>&rsquo;, before pushing it to remote branch. This allows you to commit often locally and still push  meaningful commit in the main source history. Make sure that the <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">commit messages and clear and communicates the intent</a> and helps <a href="http://megakemp.com/2014/08/14/the-importance-of-a-good-looking-history/">keep a good looking history</a>.</p>

<p>Git is one of the best things that happened to developers and hopes it stays long!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/being-explicit-about-time-when-handling-multiple-timezone/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-25T06:41:03+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/being-explicit-about-time-when-handling-multiple-timezone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This article is to put my thoughts together on a possible solution. Challenges of real world implementation are yet to be discovered.</em></p>

<p>Handling date/time in application&rsquo;s that affect different time zones is tricky! The general recommendation is that all dates be saved in UTC time and convert them as required. This works well if developers make sure of converting all dates to UTC at application boundaries and keep it consistent throughout the application.</p>

<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/yBzrPGLjMQw" class="center" title="Image By Heather Zabriskie , from https://unsplash.com/photos/yBzrPGLjMQw"><img src="/images\timezone.jpg" class="center" alt="Timezone"></a></p>

<p>At one of my clients, we are facing similar issues with date time, with an application that deals with different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">time zones</a>. The client sells office spaces across the globe and the application is for their employees to manage their clients. It integrates with various back-end systems and provides a single point of access for everything, aggregating data across those different  systems and itself. Some of the backend systems are in different locations and deal with times local to them. This increases the challenge when sending and retrieving data from them. The application has defined a set of locations, identified by, three-letter codes (<em>SYD, TRV, SEA</em>), and these locations fall under different time zones. Office spaces are at these locations and the application allows to manage those from anywhere.</p>

<p>Across the domain, we use either <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime(v=vs.110).aspx">DateTime</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetimeoffset(v=vs.110).aspx">DateTimeOffset</a> to represent time - there is a good recommendation on when to use what - <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384267(v=vs.110).aspx">Choosing Between DateTime, DateTimeOffset, TimeSpan, and TimeZoneInfo</a>. The problem with using either is that it does not play well with the domain concept to where time is related to - the location. We do have property name suffixes (not consistent though) indicating whether it is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or local - like <em>bookingDateUTC</em>, <em>paymentDateLocal</em> etc. But it so happens that these naming conventions gets broken somewhere along the different layers and leads to conversion between time zone at the application boundary layers.</p>

<h3>Issues with Current Approach</h3>

<p>DateTime and DateTimeOffset have by default time zones attached to it and it might go unnoticed till we face issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.kind(v=vs.110).aspx">Kind</a> property on DateTime indicates whether the time represents a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/shx7s921(v=vs.110).aspx">local time, UTC or neither</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetimeoffset.offset(v=vs.110).aspx">Offset</a> property on DateTimeOffset indicates the time&rsquo;s offset from UTC</li>
</ul>


<p>A common scenario in the current application is user selects a date time in the UI using a date picker, which gets send to the server as a string. This value flows through the entire system and is used to populate external systems. The problem here is that the time zone of the date time is not clear. The developer might treat this as UTC time, system local time or even time local to the location in context. This gives different results to the end user and puts the system in an inconsistent state.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">public string GetAvailability(string locationCode, DateTime? dateTime)
{
   // Code to Get as on date
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even worse this date time might get converted back and forth to different time zones, even by the same developer or other developers in the team. These conversions implicitly depend on the Kind property and goes unnoticed. One of the most common problems that we see as a result of this is that the dates might fall over to a day before or after or after, depending on where in the world the user, the server running the application is.</p>

<h3>Being Explicit Using Value Objects</h3>

<blockquote><p><em>The issue in dealing with time is about not being explicit. It&rsquo;s a good idea to tie your domain concept (location in this case) and time together</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Since time is always tied to a location (<em>SYD, TRV, SEA</em>) it&rsquo;s better to keep these together. Though DateTimeOffset and DateTime already has a timezone information attached it does not fit well into the domain, it makes more sense to have a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/thinking-beyond-primitive-values-value-objects/">Value Object</a> encapsulating time and location. Timezone by itself is less likely to fit into a domain unless time zones are a domain concept. Most likely the domain would be dealing with a location, place, airport, station etc which falls under a timezone. So it&rsquo;s a good idea to tie your domain concept and the time together. Only for the creation of the Value Object, we need the location after which it is the date time it represents that is relevant. But if by default you want to get back the date time for the same location it was created for, then location can be saved along with the Value Object. In our case, we always want to show the time at the location, so I am keeping it in the Value Object.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">public class LocationDateTime
{
    public Location Location { get; private set; }
    public DateTime DateTimeInUTC { get; private set; }
    public DateTimeOffset DateTimeAtLocation { get; private set; }

    public LocationDateTime(Location location, DateTime dateTimeUTC)
    {
        if (location == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(location));

        if (dateTimeUTC == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(dateTimeUTC));

        if (dateTimeUTC.Kind != DateTimeKind.Utc)
            throw new ArgumentException("Date Time not in UTC");

        Location = location;
        DateTimeInUTC = dateTimeUTC;
        DateTimeAtLocation = TimeAtLocation(Location);
    }

    public static LocationDateTime AtLocation(DateTime locationDateTime, Location location)
    {
        if (locationDateTime.Kind != DateTimeKind.Unspecified)
            throw new ArgumentException("DateTimeKind should be unspecified");

        var utcTime = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeToUtc(locationDateTime, location.TimeZoneInfo);
        return new LocationDateTime(location, utcTime);
    }

    public DateTimeOffset TimeAtLocation(Location location)
    {
        return TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime((DateTimeOffset)DateTimeInUTC, location.TimeZoneInfo);
    }

    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        var objAsLocationDateTime = obj as LocationDateTime;
        if ((System.Object)objAsLocationDateTime == null)
            return false;

        return objAsLocationDateTime.DateTimeInUTC == DateTimeInUTC;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return DateTimeInUTC.GetHashCode();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Value Object mandates that all date time gets tracked as UTC and allows conversion to time at different locations. The public constructor enforces this by checking the Kind property on DateTime.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The Value Object Equality is only on the UTC time it represents</em></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/blob/master/ExplicitAboutDateTime/ExplicitAboutDateTime/Location.cs">Location</a> is another Value Object, that encapsulates the code, name and the time zone it belongs to. There is a factory method that allows the creation of the value object at a location, which assumes any passed in DateTime as the time at location, and mandates the Kind property is Unspecified. You could update this to accept UTC/Local time depending on the passed in location&rsquo;s time zone, checking if both fall under the same time zone. You can also create an implicit operator to cast to DateTime or DateTimeOffset values and have it return the desired date time value that you want.</p>

<p>All occurrences of datetime in model classes can now be replaced with custom datetime value object. This makes creating a date explicit and mandates developers to make a decision on the location of datetime.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">public string Get(string locationCode, DateTime? dateTimeAtLocation)
{
    var location = GetLocation(locationCode);
    var locationDateTime = LocationDateTime.AtLocation(dateTimeAtLocation, location);
    // Code to Get as on date
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even with the above code, you cannot restrict what gets passed into the API/application boundary method, but this has made it explicit to the application on how to start treating the date time. This forces the developer to think and be explicit on the time format expected at the boundary. This might lead to better naming of the variables at the boundary - instead of <em>dateTime</em> to <em>dateTimeAtLocation</em> - and being more explicit to the outside world too!</p>

<h3>Custom Factories Using Extension Method</h3>

<p>Depending on the use case there will be a lot of ways you want to create the value object and possibility of some being used over and over again is more. You can use factory methods to help you extract out this code duplication.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin">Uncle Bob</a> points out in <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0131857258/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=0131857258&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21&amp;linkId=VVMXRINDZWYFRWP4">Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#</a>, interfaces should be closer to the client. <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/12/24/placement-of-abstract-factories/">Factories are nothing but an interface</a>, so it should be defined closer to where it&rsquo;s consumed. Creating a LocationDateTime is always tied to a DateTime object. Using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-AU/library/bb383977.aspx">Extension Methods</a> in C#, I have defined an extension on DateTime to create a LocationDateTime object.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">public static LocationDateTime ToLocationDateTime(this DateTime dateTime, Location location)
{
    if (dateTime == null)
        return null;

    if (location == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(location));

    return LocationDateTime.AtLocation(dateTime, location);
}   
</code></pre>

<p>Now creating a LocationDateTime from a DateTime is easy. Similarly, extension methods can be defined on Location, LocationDateTime to provide custom capabilities as required by the consuming clients.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">var locationDateTime = dateTimeAtLocation.ToLocationDateTime(location);
</code></pre>

<p>By using a Value Object to represent the DateTime within the application enforces developers to be more explicit on the date time at the boundaries, results in better naming of the variables at boundaries, ensures that it remains the same within the application. You can also override some of the most commonly used operators with DateTime like greater than, less than, equal to, so that it seamlessly fits into the application.</p>

<p>Hoping this will work well in the application too, let me get on to fix it!</p>

    <updated>2016-03-16T05:44:03+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/developer-learnings-from-the-ikea-experience</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we moved over to Sydney, last year, we had to start over with all the home furnishings. Since we were just starting out, didn&rsquo;t want to spent a lot on furnishings, so decided to go with <a href="http://www.ikea.com/au/en/?cid=au|ps|branded|brand|google|ikea_australia">IKEA</a> for its cost effectiveness and value for money.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>IKEA is a multinational group of companies that designs and sells ready-to-assemble furniture (such as beds, chairs and desks), appliances, small motor vehicles and home accessories. <span class="right">Wiki</span></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Right from the in-shop experience to setting it up, I found many similarities with the IKEA experience and Software Development. Visiting IKEA is an experience in itself and totally wow&rsquo;s you. If not for any of the displayed items, the &lsquo;<em>Self Serve Furniture Area</em>&rsquo; surely will. The sheer size and setup there was breath-taking for me and my wife!</p>

<p><figure>
    <img alt="IKEA Self Serve Furniture Area, Ikea Tempe" src="/images/ikea_self_serve_furniture_area.jpg" />
    <figcaption><em>This is just one of the aisle and there were around 35 of them!</em></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<h3>Code Management &amp; Inventory Management</h3>

<p>Throughout the <a href="https://shoutsfromtheabyss.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ikea-map.jpg">Showroom</a> you see an <em>Aisle number</em> and the <em>Location</em> displayed under the displayed items. For the items interested in, one can note those numbers on paper or use the mobile application to <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_KR/customer-service/apps/mobile_app_14.html">scan the QR code of the product</a> for reference. In the checkout area, you can find the item at the said aisle/location number. Finding and picking up the item from the aisle is easy and joyful.</p>

<p>Code management is an important aspect in Software development, as code bases can get quite large. Setting up a <a href="https://github.com/">version control</a> to manage code bases have become a norm and is a good practice to follow even on your side projects. Few other things to follow include</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintain a project structure, naming conventions and code conventions.</li>
<li>Code Navigability and discoverability are important for fast and smooth development. Good and descriptive class names allow us to navigate easily based on the application functionality.</li>
<li><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/893ke618(v=vs.71).aspx">Organizing Namespace</a></li>
<li>Remove unused code and not comment it out. Let the version control system take care of file history.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Manual</h3>

<p>The assembly instructions that comes with each package is clear and expressive. It&rsquo;s mostly <a href="http://www.ikea.com/au/en/assembly_instructions/malm-desk__AA-516949-7_pub.pdf">conveyed through pictures</a> and easy to follow through. The manual is up to date with the packaged product and matched exactly with the contents.</p>

<p>This shows the importance of having a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README">README</a> file or software manuals or in context help for users to use the application. Feedback messages and keeping the user always connected with the system is also important. Long wait times, unresponsive progress bars, silent suppression of error messages are not acceptable. Error messages are for the application user and the level and kind of details differs based on who the user is:</p>

<ul>
<li>For business/non-technical users, mostly of Front-end applications, Business error messages makes more value than technical errors</li>
<li>For developers consuming an API, detailed technical error messages add value than just returning a &lsquo;500 - Internal Server Error&rsquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>Error messages must be relevant and up to date with the current functionality. Always review messages for appropriateness.</p>

<p>Code comments used for communicating intent mostly gets out of sync with what the code actually does. So it&rsquo;s a better practice to avoid comments in code and break code into descriptive function and classes to convey the intent.</p>

<blockquote><p><em><a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.TimOttinger.ApologizeIncode">A comment is an apology</a> for not choosing a more clear name or a more reasonable set of parameters, or for the failure to use explanatory variables and explanatory functions.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p><img class="left" alt="IKEA Tools" src="/images/ikea_tools.jpg" /></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00169254/">FIXA 17-piece tool kit</a>, is all that you need for fitting all the furniture. Some products have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_key">Allen Key</a> packaged along with them, but otherwise, most of the time the FIXA toolkit is all that one needs.</p>

<p>Having the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">right set of tools</a> for assisting in the development and being familiar with it is important.  It&rsquo;s not just about having the best/costliest tools, but about knowing them well. Taking some time out to understand the tools that you use daily is important. By tools, I include keyboard, mouse, programming languages, IDE&rsquo;s and other support software that you use daily.</p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>


<blockquote><p><em><a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/">We are Typists First, Programmers Second</a>: The keyboard is one of the most important tools for a developer - learn it well</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Componentization</h3>

<p>The furniture comes as separate pieces that can be easily assembled, with all the screw holes of perfect size. All the different pieces fit perfectly and right even when done by an amateur. Though some of the pieces required two people to fix, I could fix them up myself. It was all cut to perfection with all the holes right in place and fits perfectly the first time.</p>

<p>Having well-defined interfaces that interact with each other seamlessly is important in software development. Any application should be composed of smaller parts that can fit together well. Adhering to good design principles and design patterns helps us to achieve this.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>One of the most important principles while using Object Oriented  languages is <strong><a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">SOLID</a></strong>:   <br/>
  Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency Injection</em></p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" alt="IKEA Components" src="/images/ikea_components.jpg" /></p>

<p>Interfaces should be well-defined and not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">leak abstractions</a>. The name and parameters(input/return) should completely abstract the &lsquo;how&rsquo; part of the functionality and expose only the &lsquo;what&rsquo;. This helps to build more robust interfaces.</p>

<h3>Packaging and Shipping</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/ikea-cant-stop-obsessing-about-its-packaging-1434533401">IKEA&rsquo;s efficiency in packaging</a> is one of the reasons that enables them to sell at a low-cost and they keep improving at it. Compact and small packages make it easy to handle right from &lsquo;self-checkout&rsquo; to unpacking it at your home. It also helps in optimizing transportation costs for IKEA which in turn enables them to reduce prices.</p>

<p><figure>
    <img alt="IKEA Packaging" src="/images/ikea_packed.jpg"></img>
    <figcaption><em>King size bed frame with storage, extendable dining table and four chairs!</em></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>Deployment in software development is a key part and having the entire pipeline automated is essential for a smooth delivery. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/automated-clickonce-deployment-of-a-wpf-application-using-appveyor/">Setting up a build server, automated building, running tests</a> etc are some of the starting points to move towards <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html">Continuous Delivery</a>. Deployment needs to be scripted and be possible to deploy to any environment at the click of a button. If it is a distributable software then easily accessible delivery mechanisms should be available and preferably offer multiple options (like distributable media, server hosted images etc like Windows)</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The package has just the right number of screws, nails and other assembly accessories - not one less, not one more!</em></p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" alt="IKEA Components" src="/images/ikea_assembly_accessories.jpg" /></p>

<p>This shows IKEA&rsquo;s confidence in the shipped product and the self-belief of nothing going wrong. For a software product to be shipped with this level of confidence it should be thoroughly tested - preferably automated, which allows verifying each time we make a release and allows us to release more often.</p>

<h3>Cost Effective</h3>

<p>Having always bought pre-assembled furniture I have never had to think about anything - it was always just about the money. But with IKEA being self-assembled, you get the flexibility to choose the components/features that you need for the furniture like you could choose to have a <a href="http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/20228714/">headboard for the bed</a> or not, which obviously implies a reduced price. You could choose to self-checkout and pay nothing, but also do a paid checkout, where an IKEA member would get all the items out for you to the billing counter. You could transport it yourself to your home or <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_AU/customer_service/ikea_services/home_delivery.html">get it delivered</a>. So it&rsquo;s all about giving you the options to choose what you want and really keep the cost low.</p>

<p>Keeping the cost low is an important aspect in software industry too and at various levels</p>

<ul>
<li>Development and Licensing  costs - Try to keep these costs low, by looking for open source alternatives and choosing your technology wisely and not just looking for the &lsquo;cool and latest&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Deployment/Infrastructure costs - Build applications for scale and as independent services so that they can be  turned on and off  as required. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">The cloud</a> has greatly reduced the infrastructure setup costs and provides an easy way for setup. Make sure you understand well the pricing models offered by various cloud providers.</li>
<li>Software Costs/Subscription Costs: Give flexibility to your consumers in how they can consume your software. Keeping functionality loosely coupled and pluggable allows to offer various subscription plans or selling model.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Value Added Services</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just in the home furnishings and their core business that IKEA has taken great care for. The other <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_SG/service-offer/">Value Added Services</a> they offer like Delivery, Assembly, Planning Tools, Gift Cards, Children&rsquo;s Services and Return Policy are top-notch.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Users are happy when the expected works, and wowed when it goes beyond expectations.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/categories/departments/food/">food at IKEA</a> is worth mentioning (and a picture) - low-priced and tasty! It caters for the needs of all kinds of people and age. The value for money attracts people to IKEA just for the food.</p>

<p><img alt="IKEA Components" src="/images/ikea_food.jpg" /></p>

<p>Any product should deliver what it&rsquo;s supposed to anyways, but it&rsquo;s in providing a bit extra that really matters. Like the few examples below,that gave a better experience to me</p>

<ul>
<li>When you hit Ctrl + V with an image in clipboard on Facebook it automatically uploads the image</li>
<li>When Amazon sent a replacement for my broken Kindle (all the way from the US to India) for free</li>
<li>When Google Now showed the <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6015842?hl=en">parking location</a>.</li>
<li>The IKEA Experience!</li>
</ul>


<p>Strive to look for cases where you can delight your customers every time you deliver a product. The IKEA has made me think about delivering products and the need for constantly improving at it. We often need to take a stop, look at what we are doing and correct things and move forward.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The only way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0132350882&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-20&amp;linkId=CVCVZFAR5SBYVMJW">code as clean</a> as possible at all times.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Head off to an IKEA store if there is one <a href="http://www.ikea.com/">near you</a> and get wowed!</p>
