    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/generating-a-large-pdf-from-website-contents-part-ii/"/>
    <updated>2017-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/generating-a-large-pdf-from-website-contents-part-ii</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the previous post, <a href="/blog/generating-a-large-pdf-from-website-contents">Generating a Large PDF from Website Contents</a> we saw from a high level the approach taken to generate PDF files from a Content Management System (CMS) website. In this post, we will delve further into the details of each of those areas.</p>

<h3>HTML To PDF</h3>

<p>There are a lot of libraries and services that support converting HTML to PDF. We chose this mechanism mainly for keeping the content formatting simple and reusable. Most of the PDF data was to be structured like the website content. This means we can reuse (read copy/paste) the HTML styling for the PDF content as well.</p>

<p>We used <a href="https://www.essentialobjects.com/Products/EOPdf/Default.aspx">Essential Objects HTML to PDF Converter</a> library. Our website is hosted as an Azure Web App and the <a href="https://www.essentialobjects.com/doc/pdf/install/deploy.aspx">Essential Objects library does not work in the Azure sandbox environment</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Azure-Web-App-sandbox#pdf-generation-from-html">Azure Sandbox restriction</a> affects most of the HTML to PDF libraries. The recommended approach to use those libraries is to host the PDF conversion logic on an Azure Virtual Machine, which is what we also ended up doing. Alternatively, you can choose to use one of the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5344176/is-there-a-web-service-for-converting-html-to-pdf">HTML to PDF hosted services</a>.</p>

<p>The below code snippet is what you need to convert an HTML URL endpoint to PDF. It uses the HtmlToPdf class from the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/EO.Pdf/">EO.Pdf Nuget package</a>. The HtmlToPdfOptions specifies various conversion and formatting options. You can set margin space, common headers, footers, etc. for the generated PDF content. It also provides extensibility points in the PDF conversion pipeline.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">public FileContentResult Convert(string url)
{
    var pdfStream = new MemoryStream();
    var pdfDocument = new PdfDocument();
    var pdfOptions = this.GetPdfOptions();

    var result = HtmlToPdf.ConvertUrl(url, pdfDocument, pdfOptions);
    pdfDocument.Save(pdfStream);

    return new FileContentResult(pdfStream.ToArray(), "application/pdf");
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p><strong><em>HTML Formatting Tip</em></strong></p>

<p><em>You might want to avoid content being split across multiple pages. E.g., images, charts, etc. In this cases, you can use the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/page-break/">page-break-*</a> CSS property to adjust page breaks. <a href="https://www.essentialobjects.com/doc/pdf/htmltopdf/paging.aspx">Essentials objects honors the page-break-*</a> settings and adjusts the content when converting into PDF.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Bookmarks</h3>

<p><em>A <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/page-thumbnails-bookmarks-pdfs.html#about_bookmarks">bookmark</a> is a type of link with representative text in the Bookmarks panel in the navigation pane. Each bookmark goes to a different view or page in the document. Bookmarks are generated automatically during PDF creation from the table-of-contents entries of a document.</em></p>

<p>We generate a lot of small PDF files (per section and category/sub-category) and then merge them together to form the larger PDF. Each of the sections has one or more entries towards Table Of Contents (TOC). We decided to generate bookmarks first per each generated PDF. When merging the individual PDF, the bookmarks are merged first, and then the TOC is created from the full bookmark tree.</p>

<p>Bookmarks can be created automatically or manually using Essential Objects library. Most of the other libraries also provide similar functionality. Using the <a href="https://www.essentialobjects.com/doc/EO.Pdf.HtmlToPdfOptions.AutoBookmark.html">AutoBookmark property</a> we can have bookmarks created automatically based on HTML header (H1-H6) elements. If this does not fit with your scenario, then you can create them manually. In our case, we insert hidden HTML tags to specify bookmarks. Bookmark hierarchy is represented using custom attributes as shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;a class="bookmark" id="TOC_Category1" name="Category1"&gt;Category 1&lt;/a&gt;
...
&lt;a class="bookmark" id="TOC_Category1_Section1" name="Section1" tocParent="TOC_Category1"&gt;Section 1&lt;/a&gt;
...
&lt;a class="bookmark" id="TOC_Category1_Section2" name="Section2" tocParent="TOC_Category1"&gt;Section 2&lt;/a&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>Once the PDF is created from the URL, we parse the HTML content for elements with <em>bookmark</em> class and manually add the bookmarks into the generated PDF. The <em><a href="https://www.essentialobjects.com/doc/EO.Pdf.HtmlDocument.GetElementsByClassName_overload_1.html">GetElementsByClassName</a></em> and the <em><a href="https://www.essentialobjects.com/doc/EO.Pdf.HtmlElement.CreateBookmark_overloads.html">CreateBookmark</a></em> methods help us to create bookmarks from the hidden HTML elements in the page.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">{
 ...
 var result = HtmlToPdf.ConvertUrl(url, pdfDocument, pdfOptions);
 BuildBookmarkTree(pdfDocument, result);
 pdfDocument.Save(pdfStream);
 ...
}

private static void BuildBookmarkTree(PdfDocument pdfDocument, HtmlToPdfResult htmlToPdfResult)
{
    var bookmarkElements = htmlToPdfResult.HtmlDocument.GetElementsByClassName("bookmark");
    foreach (var htmlElement in bookmarkElements)
    {
        var bookmark = htmlElement.CreateBookmark();
        ... // Custom logic to build the bookmark hierarchy
        // based on custom attributes or whatever approach you choose.

        pdfDocument.Bookmarks.Add(bookmark);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Handling Empty Pages</h3>

<p>In our case, the content is from a CMS, and the user gets an option to select what categories/sub-categories and sections of data to be displayed in the generated PDF. At times it happens that some of the selected combinations might not have any data in the system. To avoid printing a blank page (or an error page) in the generated PDF, we can check the conversion result to check for the returned content. Whenever the content does not exists the HTML endpoint returns an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.emptyresult(v=vs.118">EmptyResult class</a>.aspx). At the PDF conversion side, you can check if the response is empty and accordingly perform your logic to ignore the generated PDF.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">public static class HtmlToPdfResultExtensions
{
    public static bool IsEmptyResponse(this HtmlToPdfResult htmlToPdfResult)
    {
        return htmlToPdfResult != null &amp;&amp;
            htmlToPdfResult.HtmlDocument != null &amp;&amp;
            htmlToPdfResult.HtmlDocument.Body != null &amp;&amp;
            string.IsNullOrEmpty(htmlToPdfResult.HtmlDocument.Body.InnerText);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once the individual PDF files are created for each of the section and category/subcategory combination, we can merge them together to generate the full PDF. We will see in the next post how to merge the bookmarks together along with shifting the PDF pages and generating Table of Contents from the bookmarks.</p>

    <updated>2017-08-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/generating-a-large-pdf-from-website-contents</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At one of my recent clients, we had a requirement to generate a PDF dynamically based on the contents of the website. The website is a Content Management System (CMS) built on top of <a href="https://umbraco.com/">Umbraco</a>. The content is grouped into different categories and sub-categories. Each category and sub-category had different sections/sub-sections under that. Some sections are optional for certain categories, and all of these are dynamic. In this post, I will walk through at high level the approach taken to solve the problem.</p>

<p>The user selects the categories/sub-categories and the sections that they wish to export as PDF. On submit, a PDF needs to be generated based on the website content.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp Model Structure of Domain">public class Category
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public List&lt;Section&gt; Sections { get; set; }
    public List&lt;Category&gt; SubCategory { get; set; }
}

public class Section
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public List&lt;Section&gt; SubSections { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/pdf_generation.png" class="center" alt="Select options to download" /></p>

<p>The actual site had one more level of options (say sub-sections), so you can imagine the number of possible combinations to generate the content. The site content was huge as well, and a PDF with all options selected would be around 4000-5000 pages. So creating the PDF every time some one clicks the button was out of the question. We had to cache the generated PDF&rsquo;s and serve them as the request comes in. But the challenge was how to manage the cache so that we can build up the PDF based on the options selected.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you are using HTML to PDF libraries be aware that most of the libraries out there (<a href="https://www.essentialobjects.com/Products/EOPdf/Default.aspx">Essential Object</a>, <a href="http://www.evopdf.com/">EvoPDF</a> etc.) <strong>does not work on Azure Web Apps</strong>. This is because of the <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Azure-Web-App-sandbox#pdf-generation-from-html">sandbox restrictions</a> on the applications irrespective of the Azure plan you are on. The preferred solution is to host the conversion code on a VM. If you find that an overhead (which it is) consider using the SAAS alternatives for converting HTML to PDF.
</div>


<p>Below is the flow diagram of the complete process of generating the PDF as a request comes. The request specifies the categories/sub-categories along with the sections that need to be in the generated PDF.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pdf_generation_flow.png" class="center" alt="PDF Generation Flow" /></p>

<p>We decided to create a PDF file for each section per category/subcategory selection. Once all the sections are ready, all the PDF files will be merged into one. While merging we also build up the bookmark tree and the table of contents. Inserting the table of contents page at the start of the PDF requires pushing all the page numbers to match the new ones.</p>

<p>The PDF layout for individual sections per category/subcategory is in HTML. The application exposes endpoints for the HTML content for the different sections. We used <a href="https://www.essentialobjects.com/Products/EOPdf/Default.aspx">Essential Object HTML to PDF Converter</a> to convert the HTML to PDF files. Bookmarks for the associated section are embedded in HTML. While converting to PDF, the bookmarks get added to the PDF, which later gets merged into the full bookmark tree. The generated PDF file is cached for any new requests.</p>

<p>Since we have around forty categories/sub-categories, twelve section, and ten sub-sections, generating the full PDF take a while. So we generate the cache at fixed intervals and as required (when content is updated in the CMS). The above approach of generating PDF files has been working fine for us. Since the individual PDF sections are generated in isolation, it gives us the flexibility to scale the generation process as required. Combining the generated PDF files is often fast and can be cached at a different level as well to speed up the whole process.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/azure-web-restarting-automatically-due-to-overwhelming-change-notification/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/azure-web-restarting-automatically-due-to-overwhelming-change-notification</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At one of my clients, we faced a strange issue recently. The Azure Web application restarted automatically very often. The event log in the <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Kudu-console">Kudu console</a> showed the below error message.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>2017-07-13 00:09:50,333 [P45516/D4/T171] INFO  Umbraco.Core.UmbracoApplicationBase - Application shutdown. Details: HostingEnvironment</em></p>

<p><em>_shutDownMessage=Directory rename change notification for &rsquo;D:\home\site\wwwroot&#8217;.</em>  <br/>
<em>Overwhelming Change Notification in wwwroot</em>   <br/>
<em>HostingEnvironment initiated shutdown</em>  <br/>
<em>Directory rename change notification for &rsquo;D:\home\site\wwwroot&#8217;.</em>   <br/>
<em>Overwhelming Change Notification in wwwroot</em>   <br/>
<em>Initialization Error</em>   <br/>
<em>HostingEnvironment caused shutdown</em></p></blockquote>

<p>As you can tell from the logs, the website is an <a href="https://umbraco.com/">Umbraco</a> CMS hosted as an Azure Web application. We noticed that the restarts were happening more when the content was getting updated through <a href="https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/getting-started/backoffice/">backoffice</a>. The error also states that the restart was caused due to <em>Overwhelming Change Notification in wwwroot</em>. This hints that there are changes that are happening under the wwwroot folder, where the site is hosted.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
Even though this post details on why the specific site on Umbraco was restarting, most of the contents are still applicable for any other ASP.NET MVC application.
</div>


<h3>fcnMode Configuration</h3>

<p>A quick search got me to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.configuration.httpruntimesection.fcnmode(v=vs.110">fcnMode</a>.aspx)setting under <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.configuration.httpruntimesection(v=vs.110">httpRuntime</a>.aspx) section. An ASP.net application monitors certain files and folders under the wwwroot folder and will restart the application domain whenever it detects changes. This likely look looks the reason why the web site is restarting.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.configuration.fcnmode(v=vs.110">fcnMode enumeration</a>.aspx) can take one of the four values below. For an Umbraco application this is by <a href="http://issues.umbraco.org/issue/U4-7712">default set to <em>Single</em></a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Default</strong>: For each subdirectory, the application creates an object that monitors the subdirectory. This is the default behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Disabled</strong>: File change notification is disabled.</li>
<li><strong>NotSet</strong>: File change notification is not set, so the application creates an object that monitors each subdirectory. This is the default behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Single</strong>: The application creates one object to monitor the main directory and uses this object to monitor each subdirectory.</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="xml fcnMode set to Single for Umbraco application">&lt;system.web&gt;
    ...
    &lt;httpRuntime 
        requestValidationMode="2.0" 
        enableVersionHeader="false"
        targetFramework="4.5"
        maxRequestLength="51200" 
        fcnMode="Single" /&gt;
    ...
&lt;system.web&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p><em>FCNMode creates a monitor object with a buffer size of 4KB for each folder. When FCNMode is set to Single, a single monitor object is created with a buffer size of 64KB. When there are file changes, the buffer is filled with file change information. If the buffer gets overwhelmed with too many file change notifications an “Overwhelming File Change Notifications” error will occur and the app domain will recycle. The likelihood of the buffer getting overwhelmed is higher in an environment where you are using separate file server because the folder paths are much larger.</em></p>

<p>-<a href="http://www.dnnsoftware.com/community-blog/cid/154980/aspnet-file-change-notifications-and-dnn"> ASP.NET File Change Notifications and DNN</a></p></blockquote>

<p>You can read more about fcnMode setting and how it affects ASP.Net applications <a href="https://shazwazza.com/post/all-about-aspnet-file-change-notification-fcn/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s causing file changes?</h3>

<p>Default reaction when you come across such a setting or configuration value might be to turn that off and fcnMode does allow that as well - <em>Disabled</em>. But first, it is better that we understand what is causing file changes under the wwwroot folder and see if we can address that. The <a href="https://shazwazza.com/post/fcn-file-change-notification-viewer-for-aspnet/">FCN Viewer</a> helps visualize how many files and folders are being watched in as ASP.Net application.</p>

<p>In the Umbraco website, we are using a third party library <a href="http://imageprocessor.org/">ImageProcessor</a> that helps to process images dynamically. The ImageProcessor caches images and the <a href="http://imageprocessor.org/imageprocessor-web/configuration/#cacheconfig">cache location is configurable</a>. By default, it caches files under the App_Data/cache folder, which also happens to be one of the folders that the ASP.Net application monitors for changes. So anytime there are lots of files changing in the cache folder it causes the single monitor object monitoring the folders. This causes a buffer overflow and triggers an application restart due to <em>Overwhelming file change notifications</em>. However, ImageProcessor does allow moving the <a href="https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor/issues/518">cache folder outside of the wwwroot folder</a>. This causes the file not to be monitored and still work fine with the application. Since the <a href="https://twitter.com/Shazwazza/status/885770960321773568">library does not create the cache folder automatically</a>, we need to make sure that the folder specified in the config file exists.</p>

<p>Having moved the cache folder outside of the wwwroot, I no longer need to update the fcnMode setting and can leave it as intended. If you are facing application restarts as well due to overwhelming change notification in wwwroot see what is likely causing the file changes and then try and fix that instead of just setting the fcnMode to disabled.</p>

<p>Hope that helps fix your application restarting problem!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/left-align-your-code-for-better-readability/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/left-align-your-code-for-better-readability</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aesthetics of code is as important as the code you write. Aligning is an important part that contributes to the overall aesthetics of code. The importance of code aesthetics struck me while on a recent project. Below are some the code samples that I came across in the project. Traversing this code base was painful to me as the code was all over the place.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp Bad Formatting">public class Account
{
    public long   Id                    { get; set; }
    public string ClientId              { get; set; }
    public long   ContactId             { get; set; }
    public string UserName              { get; set; }
    public string Name                  { get; set; }
    public string Company               { get; set; }
    public string Address               { get; set; }
    public string BillingAddress        { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="csharp Bad Formatting">public ConnectToServer(string username, 
                       string password,
                       string server,
                       string port)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code has too many alignment points that attract the eye which makes it hard to read in the first place. When in isolation this might still be fine to read, but with such a style across the code base, it soon becomes a pain for your eyes and your mind. When refactoring code, it becomes even harder as you need to put in the extra effort to make sure that this fancy alignment is maintained. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how even changing a property name (<em>Company to CompanyName</em>) or function name(<em>ConnectToServer to Connect</em>) will affect the current formatting.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp Renamed to CompanyName">public class Account
{
    ...
    public string Name              { get; set; }
    public string CompanyName           { get; set; }
    public string Address           { get; set; }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="csharp Renamed to Connect">public Connect(string username, 
                       string password,
                       string server,
                       string port)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see above the formatting is now all over the place, and you need to format them into place manually. Again when in isolation this might seem like a few press of spacebar. But when the property/function that you rename is used in multiple places this soon becomes a problem. Such code formatting introduces maintenance overhead and soon falls out of place if something gets missed.</p>

<h3>Better Ways To Format Code</h3>

<p>Left aligning code is one of the key things that I try to follow always. Keeping the code aligned to the left makes it easier to read (assuming that you are programming in a language written from left to right). Since we read from left to right having most of the code aligned to the left means that you have more code visible. Left aligning also means that you would almost avoid the need to scroll the code editor when reading through the code horizontally.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look how left aligning the above code will look like.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp Left Aligned">public class Account
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string ClientId { get; set; }
    public long ContactId { get; set; }
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Company { get; set; }
    public string Address { get; set; }
    public string BillingAddress { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="csharp Left Aligned Multiple Lines">public ConnectToServer(
    string username, 
    string password,
    string server,
    string port)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="csharp Left Aligned Single Line">public ConnectToServer(
    string username, string password, string server, string port)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see above left aligning makes it much easier to read and also reduces the number of alignment points. This is also refactoring friendly as there are no specific space patterns that need to be maintained. As for the parameters in a single line VS parameters in multiple lines (as above), I prefer the multi-line approach, as it keeps the code further aligned to the left and also reduces the chance of getting a horizontal scroll bar.

<p>Code formatting is an important aspect of coding. It is important that as a team you need to agree on some standard practices and find ways to stick to it.

It takes a while for any new practices to set in, but soon it will be of second nature and easy to follow.</p>
