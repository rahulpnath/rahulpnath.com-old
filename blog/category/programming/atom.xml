    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/generating-a-large-pdf-from-website-contents</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At one of my recent clients, we had a requirement to generate a PDF dynamically based on the contents of the website. The website is a Content Management System (CMS) built on top of <a href="https://umbraco.com/">Umbraco</a>. The content is grouped into different categories and sub-categories. Each category and sub-category had different sections/sub-sections under that. Some sections are optional for certain categories, and all of these are dynamic. In this post, I will walk through at high level the approach taken to solve the problem.</p>

<p>The user selects the categories/sub-categories and the sections that they wish to export as PDF. On submit, a PDF needs to be generated based on the website content.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp Model Structure of Domain">public class Category
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public List&lt;Section&gt; Sections { get; set; }
    public List&lt;Category&gt; SubCategory { get; set; }
}

public class Section
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public List&lt;Section&gt; SubSections { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/pdf_generation.png" class="center" alt="Select options to download" /></p>

<p>The actual site had one more level of options (say sub-sections), so you can imagine the number of possible combinations to generate the content. The site content was huge as well, and a PDF with all options selected would be around 4000-5000 pages. So creating the PDF every time some one clicks the button was out of the question. We had to cache the generated PDF&rsquo;s and serve them as the request comes in. But the challenge was how to manage the cache so that we can build up the PDF based on the options selected.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you are using HTML to PDF libraries be aware that most of the libraries out there (<a href="https://www.essentialobjects.com/Products/EOPdf/Default.aspx">Essential Object</a>, <a href="http://www.evopdf.com/">EvoPDF</a> etc.) <strong>does not work on Azure Web Apps</strong>. This is because of the <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Azure-Web-App-sandbox#pdf-generation-from-html">sandbox restrictions</a> on the applications irrespective of the Azure plan you are on. The preferred solution is to host the conversion code on a VM. If you find that an overhead (which it is) consider using the SAAS alternatives for converting HTML to PDF.
</div>


<p>Below is the flow diagram of the complete process of generating the PDF as a request comes. The request specifies the categories/sub-categories along with the sections that need to be in the generated PDF.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pdf_generation_flow.png" class="center" alt="PDF Generation Flow" /></p>

<p>We decided to create a PDF file for each section per category/subcategory selection. Once all the sections are ready, all the PDF files will be merged into one. While merging we also build up the bookmark tree and the table of contents. Inserting the table of contents page at the start of the PDF requires pushing all the page numbers to match the new ones.</p>

<p>The PDF layout for individual sections per category/subcategory is in HTML. The application exposes endpoints for the HTML content for the different sections. We used <a href="https://www.essentialobjects.com/Products/EOPdf/Default.aspx">Essential Object HTML to PDF Converter</a> to convert the HTML to PDF files. Bookmarks for the associated section are embedded in HTML. While converting to PDF, the bookmarks get added to the PDF, which later gets merged into the full bookmark tree. The generated PDF file is cached for any new requests.</p>

<p>Since we have around forty categories/sub-categories, twelve section, and ten sub-sections, generating the full PDF take a while. So we generate the cache at fixed intervals and as required (when content is updated in the CMS). The above approach of generating PDF files has been working fine for us. Since the individual PDF sections are generated in isolation, it gives us the flexibility to scale the generation process as required. Combining the generated PDF files is often fast and can be cached at a different level as well to speed up the whole process.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/azure-web-restarting-automatically-due-to-overwhelming-change-notification/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/azure-web-restarting-automatically-due-to-overwhelming-change-notification</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At one of my clients, we faced a strange issue recently. The Azure Web application restarted automatically very often. The event log in the <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Kudu-console">Kudu console</a> showed the below error message.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>2017-07-13 00:09:50,333 [P45516/D4/T171] INFO  Umbraco.Core.UmbracoApplicationBase - Application shutdown. Details: HostingEnvironment</em></p>

<p><em>_shutDownMessage=Directory rename change notification for &rsquo;D:\home\site\wwwroot&#8217;.</em>  <br/>
<em>Overwhelming Change Notification in wwwroot</em>   <br/>
<em>HostingEnvironment initiated shutdown</em>  <br/>
<em>Directory rename change notification for &rsquo;D:\home\site\wwwroot&#8217;.</em>   <br/>
<em>Overwhelming Change Notification in wwwroot</em>   <br/>
<em>Initialization Error</em>   <br/>
<em>HostingEnvironment caused shutdown</em></p></blockquote>

<p>As you can tell from the logs, the website is an <a href="https://umbraco.com/">Umbraco</a> CMS hosted as an Azure Web application. We noticed that the restarts were happening more when the content was getting updated through <a href="https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/getting-started/backoffice/">backoffice</a>. The error also states that the restart was caused due to <em>Overwhelming Change Notification in wwwroot</em>. This hints that there are changes that are happening under the wwwroot folder, where the site is hosted.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
Even though this post details on why the specific site on Umbraco was restarting, most of the contents are still applicable for any other ASP.NET MVC application.
</div>


<h3>fcnMode Configuration</h3>

<p>A quick search got me to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.configuration.httpruntimesection.fcnmode(v=vs.110">fcnMode</a>.aspx)setting under <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.configuration.httpruntimesection(v=vs.110">httpRuntime</a>.aspx) section. An ASP.net application monitors certain files and folders under the wwwroot folder and will restart the application domain whenever it detects changes. This likely look looks the reason why the web site is restarting.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.configuration.fcnmode(v=vs.110">fcnMode enumeration</a>.aspx) can take one of the four values below. For an Umbraco application this is by <a href="http://issues.umbraco.org/issue/U4-7712">default set to <em>Single</em></a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Default</strong>: For each subdirectory, the application creates an object that monitors the subdirectory. This is the default behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Disabled</strong>: File change notification is disabled.</li>
<li><strong>NotSet</strong>: File change notification is not set, so the application creates an object that monitors each subdirectory. This is the default behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Single</strong>: The application creates one object to monitor the main directory and uses this object to monitor each subdirectory.</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="xml fcnMode set to Single for Umbraco application">&lt;system.web&gt;
    ...
    &lt;httpRuntime 
        requestValidationMode="2.0" 
        enableVersionHeader="false"
        targetFramework="4.5"
        maxRequestLength="51200" 
        fcnMode="Single" /&gt;
    ...
&lt;system.web&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p><em>FCNMode creates a monitor object with a buffer size of 4KB for each folder. When FCNMode is set to Single, a single monitor object is created with a buffer size of 64KB. When there are file changes, the buffer is filled with file change information. If the buffer gets overwhelmed with too many file change notifications an “Overwhelming File Change Notifications” error will occur and the app domain will recycle. The likelihood of the buffer getting overwhelmed is higher in an environment where you are using separate file server because the folder paths are much larger.</em></p>

<p>-<a href="http://www.dnnsoftware.com/community-blog/cid/154980/aspnet-file-change-notifications-and-dnn"> ASP.NET File Change Notifications and DNN</a></p></blockquote>

<p>You can read more about fcnMode setting and how it affects ASP.Net applications <a href="https://shazwazza.com/post/all-about-aspnet-file-change-notification-fcn/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s causing file changes?</h3>

<p>Default reaction when you come across such a setting or configuration value might be to turn that off and fcnMode does allow that as well - <em>Disabled</em>. But first, it is better that we understand what is causing file changes under the wwwroot folder and see if we can address that. The <a href="https://shazwazza.com/post/fcn-file-change-notification-viewer-for-aspnet/">FCN Viewer</a> helps visualize how many files and folders are being watched in as ASP.Net application.</p>

<p>In the Umbraco website, we are using a third party library <a href="http://imageprocessor.org/">ImageProcessor</a> that helps to process images dynamically. The ImageProcessor caches images and the <a href="http://imageprocessor.org/imageprocessor-web/configuration/#cacheconfig">cache location is configurable</a>. By default, it caches files under the App_Data/cache folder, which also happens to be one of the folders that the ASP.Net application monitors for changes. So anytime there are lots of files changing in the cache folder it causes the single monitor object monitoring the folders. This causes a buffer overflow and triggers an application restart due to <em>Overwhelming file change notifications</em>. However, ImageProcessor does allow moving the <a href="https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor/issues/518">cache folder outside of the wwwroot folder</a>. This causes the file not to be monitored and still work fine with the application. Since the <a href="https://twitter.com/Shazwazza/status/885770960321773568">library does not create the cache folder automatically</a>, we need to make sure that the folder specified in the config file exists.</p>

<p>Having moved the cache folder outside of the wwwroot, I no longer need to update the fcnMode setting and can leave it as intended. If you are facing application restarts as well due to overwhelming change notification in wwwroot see what is likely causing the file changes and then try and fix that instead of just setting the fcnMode to disabled.</p>

<p>Hope that helps fix your application restarting problem!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/left-align-your-code-for-better-readability/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/left-align-your-code-for-better-readability</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aesthetics of code is as important as the code you write. Aligning is an important part that contributes to the overall aesthetics of code. The importance of code aesthetics struck me while on a recent project. Below are some the code samples that I came across in the project. Traversing this code base was painful to me as the code was all over the place.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp Bad Formatting">public class Account
{
    public long   Id                    { get; set; }
    public string ClientId              { get; set; }
    public long   ContactId             { get; set; }
    public string UserName              { get; set; }
    public string Name                  { get; set; }
    public string Company               { get; set; }
    public string Address               { get; set; }
    public string BillingAddress        { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="csharp Bad Formatting">public ConnectToServer(string username, 
                       string password,
                       string server,
                       string port)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code has too many alignment points that attract the eye which makes it hard to read in the first place. When in isolation this might still be fine to read, but with such a style across the code base, it soon becomes a pain for your eyes and your mind. When refactoring code, it becomes even harder as you need to put in the extra effort to make sure that this fancy alignment is maintained. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how even changing a property name (<em>Company to CompanyName</em>) or function name(<em>ConnectToServer to Connect</em>) will affect the current formatting.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp Renamed to CompanyName">public class Account
{
    ...
    public string Name              { get; set; }
    public string CompanyName           { get; set; }
    public string Address           { get; set; }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="csharp Renamed to Connect">public Connect(string username, 
                       string password,
                       string server,
                       string port)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see above the formatting is now all over the place, and you need to format them into place manually. Again when in isolation this might seem like a few press of spacebar. But when the property/function that you rename is used in multiple places this soon becomes a problem. Such code formatting introduces maintenance overhead and soon falls out of place if something gets missed.</p>

<h3>Better Ways To Format Code</h3>

<p>Left aligning code is one of the key things that I try to follow always. Keeping the code aligned to the left makes it easier to read (assuming that you are programming in a language written from left to right). Since we read from left to right having most of the code aligned to the left means that you have more code visible. Left aligning also means that you would almost avoid the need to scroll the code editor when reading through the code horizontally.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look how left aligning the above code will look like.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp Left Aligned">public class Account
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string ClientId { get; set; }
    public long ContactId { get; set; }
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Company { get; set; }
    public string Address { get; set; }
    public string BillingAddress { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="csharp Left Aligned Multiple Lines">public ConnectToServer(
    string username, 
    string password,
    string server,
    string port)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="csharp Left Aligned Single Line">public ConnectToServer(
    string username, string password, string server, string port)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see above left aligning makes it much easier to read and also reduces the number of alignment points. This is also refactoring friendly as there are no specific space patterns that need to be maintained. As for the parameters in a single line VS parameters in multiple lines (as above), I prefer the multi-line approach, as it keeps the code further aligned to the left and also reduces the chance of getting a horizontal scroll bar. You can use <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/introducing-code-formatting-into-a-large-codebase/">Column Guides</a> to remind yourself to keep the code within the acceptable horizontal space.</p>

<p>Code formatting is an important aspect of coding. It is important that as a team you need to agree on some standard practices and find ways to stick to it. You can use <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/introducing-code-formatting-into-a-large-codebase/">styling tools</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/code-review/">Code Reviews</a>, etc. to make sure it does not get missed. It takes a while for any new practices to set in, but soon it will be of second nature and easy to follow.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/using-git-locally-in-a-tfvc-repository/"/>
    <updated>2017-06-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/using-git-locally-in-a-tfvc-repository</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The project that I am currently working on using <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/tfvc/overview">Team Foundation Version Control</a>(TFVC) as it&rsquo;s source control. After <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/git-checkout-tfs/">using Git</a> for a long time it felt hard to move back to TFVC. One of the biggest pain for me is losing the short commits that I do when working. Short commits help keep track of the work and also quickly revert unwanted changes. Branching is also much easier with Git and allows to switch between work without much hassle of &lsquo;<em>shelving -> undoing -> pulling back the latest as with TFS.</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p><img src="/images/tfvc_local_git.png" alt="Use Git Locally in a TFVC Repository" class="center" /></p>

<p>The best part with git is that you can use it to work with any folder in your system and does not need any setup. By just running &lsquo;<em><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init">git init</a></em>&rsquo; it initializes a git repository in the folder. Running <em>init</em> against my local TFVC source code folder, I initialized a git repository locally. Now it allows me to work locally using git - make commits, revert, change branches, etc. Whenever I reach a logical end to the work, I create a shelveset and push the changes up the TFVC source control from Visual Studio.</p>

<p>If you want to interact with the TFVC source control straight from the command line, you can try out <a href="https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs">git-tfs</a> - a Git/TFS bridge. For me, since I am happy working locally with git and pushing up the finished work as shelvesets from Visual Studio I have not explored the git-tfs tool.</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone if you feel stuck with TFVC repositories!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/refactoring-to-composite-pattern/"/>
    <updated>2017-04-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/refactoring-to-composite-pattern</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I often come across functions that do multiple things. Many times such functions have a common pattern where multiple sections within the function use the same parameters for calculations. The results from these different code sections within the function are either separated by conditionals (if, switch, etc.) or combined using various arithmetic operators. The most obvious refactoring in such scenarios is to move the code sections into different functions within the same class. Having it in separate functions keeps the code readable. But on closer observation, such functions can be moved into different classes, keeping each of these code sections as the only responsibility.</p>

<h3>Identifying the Refactoring</h3>

<p>Within a function when a similar pattern of code repeats, it could be refactored into multiple classes and composed to give the same functionality. Let us take a simple example of a function where we are validating an Account object based on different criteria. The various criteria end up as conditionals within the function. This function can soon get big and difficult to manage. It also makes it harder to test. If you are adding more validations to this class over a period you are violating the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), the O in <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">SOLID</a>. Depending on the level of abstraction that we are looking at, the class also violates the Single Responsibility Principle(SRP), the S in SOLID. The function handles validations based on different criteria.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">public List&lt;string&gt; Validate(Account account)
{
    var result = new List&lt;string&gt;();

    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(account.Email))
        result.Add("No email");
    else if (!IsValidEmailFormat(account.Email))
        result.Add("Email not valid");

    if (account.BillingDetails == null)
        result.Add("Billing Details does not exists");

    ...

    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>The Composite Pattern</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern">Composite pattern</a> is appropriate when the client ignores the difference between the composition of objects and individual objects. The pattern helps developers to maintain the complexity of the code and also separate out class responsibilities.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly</em></p></blockquote>

<p><img alt="Composite Pattern" src="/images/composite_pattern.png" /></p>

<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>In the Account validation above, the function checks for an email and validates the format, checks for valid billing details, etc. The validations could also extend on to users attached to the account and check if there is at least one user, the user has email, phone number, etc. Each of these validations can be moved into separate classes and composed together in one class so that they are all executed when an account needs to be validated. You can see a tree like hierarchy forming here, and the actual validation is composed of all these validations</p>

<p><img alt="Account Validation hierarchy" src="/images/composite_pattern_validation.png" /></p>

<p>The actual C# code looks like this after the refactoring.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">public interface IValidateAccount
{
    IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Validate(Account account);
}

public class AccountValidators : IValidateAccount
{
    public readonly IEnumerable&lt;IValidateAccount&gt; Validators;
    public AccountValidators()
    {
        Validators = new List&lt;IValidateAccount&gt;()
        {
          new AccountHasEmailValidator(),
          new AccountEmailIsValidValidator(),
          new AccountHasBillingDetailsValidator()
          ... // Add more validators
        };
    }
    public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Validate(Account account)
    {
        return Validators.SelectMany(validator =&gt; validator.Validate(account));
    }
}

public class AccountHasEmailValidator : IValidateAccount
{
    public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Validate(Account account)
    {
        if (account != null &amp;&amp; string.IsNullOrEmpty(account.Email))
            yield return "No email";
    }
}

public class AccountEmailIsValidValidator : IValidateAccount
{
    public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Validate(Account account)
    {
        if (account != null &amp;&amp; account.Email != null &amp;&amp; !IsValidEmail(account.Email))
            yield return "Email not valid";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After the refactoring, we have separate classes for each of the validation rules. The <em>AccountValidators</em> class composes all the other validators and provides the same uniform interface for the consumers to validate an account. It calls on to all the Validators iteratively and invokes the Validate method on them. You can use Dependency Injection to inject in all validators to this class if you are not comfortable hard-wiring them. The IoC container can be setup using <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/ioc-registration-by-convention/">registration by convention</a>, which prevents the needs for explicit registration for any new validators.</p>

<p>One other worry that I have seen common when moving to such a pattern is that - <em>We now have a lot more classes. Does that not affect the performance?</em>. If you are following SOLID principles to the core and want to maintain loose coupling in your code then creating more classes is something you cannot avoid. We do not want any
<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?GodClass">God Classes</a> in our code and the first step towards it is to split them into different classes.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>If an Object Oriented language cannot handle the creation of many classes and objects then why should we be using it in the first place?</em></p>

<p>-<em><a href="https://vimeo.com/68378923">Big Object Graphs Up Front, Mark Seemann</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>The composition can be complex conditions as in the case below. For, e.g., let&rsquo;s say we need to execute a different kind of algorithm to calculate based on a property.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">public class AccountCalculator : ICalculate
{
    public AccountCalculator(ICalculate calculate1, ICalculate calculate2, ICalculate calculate3)
    {
        ...
    }

    public int Calculate(Account account)
    {
        if(account.PropertyExists)
            return calculate1.Calculate();
        else
              return calculate2.Calculate() + calculate3.Calculate();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above composition makes it easy to test the composed parts and the composition separately. It also helps keep the tests simple and easy to understand. The code is separated into maintainable classes and each criteria can be modified independently.</p>

<p>Composite Pattern is a useful technique to keep code maintainable and readable. Identifying the pattern is a bit of a challenge, but the more you see it the more familiar you will be. Hope this helps!</p>
