  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Templates/Scaffolding is something that we are all used to nowadays, given that we use an IDE for development. Visual Studio is one popular IDE, that is very popular among people developing on the Microsoft platform. Visual studio comes with a lot of pre-installed templates and scaffolding templates and also has a rich extension support from the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?f%5B0%5D.Type=RootCategory&amp;f%5B0%5D.Value=templates&amp;f%5B0%5D.Text=Templates">community</a>. While developing on text editors(say like <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> which is what I have been using), which are not for any specific technology you might not have all the templating and scaffolding supported right out of the box. You might find plugins for specific editors but not for all the frameworks that are available today.</p>

<p><a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> is the Web&rsquo;s scaffolding tool for Modern Web Apps. Yeoman is a command line tool that runs over <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. Setting it up is pretty easy with the instructions <a href="http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html">here</a>. To scaffold web applications, which is the same as creating a new project in Visual Studio from a template, we need to install framework specific generators for Yeoman. There are some `<a href="http://yeoman.io/generators/official.html">officially maintained generators</a> and also ones that are <a href="http://yeoman.io/generators/community.html">maintained by the community</a>.</p>

<p>KnockoutJs helps you simplify dynamic JavaScript UIs using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. If you are new to knockout and come from a XAML backgorund, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/knockoutjs-for-xaml-developers/">KnockoutJS For XAML Developers</a>, would help you.   For KnockoutJs, there is an awesome generator that is written by <a href="https://twitter.com/stevensanderson">Steve Sanderson</a>, the creator of knockout itself and is available <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/generator-ko">here</a>. You can install this as below</p>

<blockquote><p>$ npm install generator-ko</p></blockquote>

<p>Once installed you can generate your web app from the command prompt and running the command &lsquo;<strong>yo ko</strong>&rsquo;. This is will ask for the name of the project, whether to use JavaScript or TypeScript and also if you need to include automated tests using Jasmine and Karma. On giving your options your web app would be  scaffolded out.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="hp_dv4" src="/images/yo_ko.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Project Structure</strong></p>

<p>The generated web app is a simple Single Page Application(SPA), using the components feature released with <a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2014/08/18/knockout-3-2-0-released/">Knockout 3.2.0</a>, <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> to manage packages and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> for the build</p>

<p><img class="left" alt="hp_dv4" src="/images/yo_ko_structure.png" /> The generator creates the folder structure as shown here and by default has setup the required packages. It uses the following packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>: Responsive UI framework</li>
<li><a href="http://millermedeiros.github.io/crossroads.js/">Crossroads</a>: Routing Library</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/millermedeiros/hasher/">Hahser</a>: Browsing History Manager</li>
<li><a href="http://jquery.com/">Jquery</a>: Feature rich library</li>
<li><a href="http://millermedeiros.github.io/js-signals/">Js-Signals</a>: Custom/Event Messaging System</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/knockoutjs-for-xaml-developers/">Knockout</a>: Simplifies dynamic Javascript UIs with <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tag/mvvm/">MVVM pattern</a></li>
<li><a href="http://requirejs.org/">Requirejs</a>: File and Module Loader</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/requirejs/text">Requirejs-text</a>: AMD loader plugin for text resources</li>
</ul>


<p>There are three components: <em>about-page</em>, <em>home-page</em> and <em>nav-bar</em>. The main, <em>index.html</em> composes these components into the full blown view. The nav-bar component is referred as is and the home and about page are dynamically loaded based on the nav-bar menu interaction. As shown below the <em>div</em> binds to the component based on the selected route.We look further deep on how the view models bind and these components are tied together.<br style="clear:both;" /></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;nav-bar</span> <span class="na">params=</span><span class="s">&quot;route: route&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/nav-bar&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;page&quot;</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;container&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;component: { name: route().page, params: route }&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The javascript modules are loaded using Requirejs and the startup class for this is <em>app/starup.js</em> as defined in the data-main attribute in index.html. The knockout components are registered here and view-bindings are setup.Registering a component can be in multiple ways and is well explained in the article <a href="http://www.knockmeout.net/2014/06/knockout-3-2-preview-components.html">here</a>. The <em>currentRoute</em> object is what gets binded to the page and is defined in the app/router.js where the crossroads is setup. To use any other routing library of your choice this is where you would need to update. Whenever a user clicks a menu item and navigates to a new route, the currentRoute is updated, which in turn triggers the corresponding component to get loaded. <a href="https://github.com/millermedeiros/hasher/">Hasher</a> library is used to listen to browser navigation events and update them to crossroads, where the input is parsed and dispatch matched signal for the first Route that matches the input.</p>

<p>The knockout components are defined in the <em>components</em> folder and has both the html and js parts in the same component folder. Whenever the component is loaded the viewmodel defined in the corresponding js file gets bounded to it. This way of developments helps to keep different components of the app well separated as modules and compose them into the view as required.</p>

<p>The build is managed is using <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>, which can be installed using <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp">npm</a>. To build the project, you need to run <em>gulp</em> at the root folder. The build packages all the javascript modules/files into a single file, replaces the required updates in the html file, minifies the html, js and css etc. If not for the build systems, the application would  have to make lots of file/scripts/css requests or would have to have it all in the same file while development which makes working as a team difficult. These build system are highly configurable and can be used to setup output as required. The build tasks are defined in the <em>gulpfile.js</em> and the &lsquo;<em>default</em>&rsquo; task runs when running the gulp command. This is will generate the optimized files in the <em>dist</em> folder, which can be hosted in the server of your choice. I use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/http-server">zero-configuration command-line http-server</a> available on nodejs.</p>

<p><img src="/images/yo_ko_app.png" alt="yo ko application " /></p>

<p><strong>Adding New Components</strong></p>

<p>To add new components the knockout generator provides a command which generated the html/css components in the appropriate folder. You would still need to add the registration of the component in the startup file.</p>

<blockquote><p>yo ko:component &lt;component name&gt;</p></blockquote>

<p>This is just a starting point on building Single Page Applications using knockoutjs. Start on from here to build great web applications.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/knockoutjs-for-xaml-developers/" itemprop="url">KnockoutJS For XAML Developers</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>After a very long time since I have actually wanted to move out to web development, recently I have started developing a website as part of my personal project, along with a friend of mine. I have been into desktop/mobile development on Microsoft technologies, using XAML for a very long time. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tag/mvvm/">Model-View-View Model (MVVM)</a> is a pattern that got popular because of the powerful binding engine in XAML. It is always comforting to see familiar patterns while moving into unexplored technology areas. Same is the reason I chose to explore <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/index.html">KnockoutJS</a>(KO), which simplifies dynamic JavaScript UIs with the MVVM pattern.</p>

<p><img src="/images/MVVM_Knockoutjs.jpg" alt="MVVM Knockout" /></p>

<p>KnockoutJS acts as the binding engine in XAML and binds your ViewModel(VM) with your View as shown in the figure. As you expect, like in XAML it provides a way to specify declarative-bindings on html using the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/binding-syntax.html">data-bind</a> attribute and is also widely <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/browser-support.html">supported across different browsers</a>. The Model is the data that is populated from the server after your business logics applied,  mostly populated out of Ajax JSON calls from a web service/api. This Model data might mostly need some transformation to map to your View needs which is what exactly the ViewModel does. It transforms the Model data and wraps over it to provide features like 2-way-binding, client side validation, transformation of properties, UI specific state and a lot more</p>

<p>We will see below how some of the major constructs in XAML map over to KnockoutJS.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>I assume that you are a XAML developer and am not including detailed code samples for the XAML part and would be just mentioning them.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>1. INotifyPropertyChanged</strong></p>

<p>Notifying data bounded clients on updates to the underlying bound data is a typical scenario in XAML, where we use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanged(v=vs.110).aspx">INotifyPropertyChanged</a> interface. This is also required on web pages and is handled by KO using <em><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html">observables</a></em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">personVM</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">Name</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">ko</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">observable</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Rahul&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">Age</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">ko</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">observable</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Declaring the property as an observable, makes any changes to the property immediately reflect on the bound UI elements, just like it happens on a property of a class that implements INotifyPropertyChanged.</p>

<pre class="codepen" data-height="300" data-type="js" data-href="CuIfK" data-user="rahulpnath"><code> </code></pre>


<script async src="http://codepen.io:/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


<p><strong>2. DataContext</strong></p>

<p>In XAML we set the DataContext as the ViewModel to start binding the data from the ViewModel on the UI. Similarly in KO we have to call on to <em>applyBindings </em>method, passing on the ViewModel object to bind. You can see this in the above sample. You can also pass in an additional parameter indicating the part of the document that you want to explicitly bind to.</p>

<p><strong>3. DataBinding</strong></p>

<p>Binding the data to the UI in XAML is done declaratively using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.binding(v=vs.110).aspx">Binding</a> syntax. Similarly in KO we use the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/binding-syntax.html">data-bind</a> attribute to bind to a registered, built-in or custom, binding handler. As opposed to XAML where we bind to different properties, in KO all bindings are mentioned in the same data-bind attribute, separated by comma. A binding in KO consists of a name value pair separated by a colon, where the name corresponds to the binding handler/the property that we are binding to and the value from the VM that we need it to be bound to. A simple example of binding to the text property of a label would be <em>data-bind=&ldquo;text: Name&rdquo; . </em>You can also use the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/with-binding.html">with binding</a> to create binding contexts for descendant elements as in XAML</p>

<p><strong>4. INotifyCollectionChanged</strong></p>

<p>In XAML updates to a collection is usually handled using an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms668604(v=vs.110).aspx">ObservableCollection</a>, which notifies the UI whenever an item is added/removed to the collection. Similarly in KO you can use <em>observableArray</em>, which behaves the same as ObservableCollection. It notifies the bound UI elements whenever an element is added/removed from the array. Updates or changes to individual properties on the actual objects in the array is notified to the UI only if the property is an <em>observable, </em>as in XAML. In the below sample, you can try adding an observable item or a non-observable item to the list. As soon as you add an item it reflects in the list. But selecting and editing an item will reflect in the list only if you are editing an observable item. </p>

<pre class="codepen" data-height="300" data-type="js" data-href="FreIv" data-user="rahulpnath"><code> </code></pre>


<script async src="http://codepen.io:/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


<p><strong>5. Dependent Properties</strong></p>

<p>In XAML when there are properties dependent on others , to notify changes we have to explicitly call RaisePropertyChanged on all the dependent properties. A very common example is below</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>

<p>Here whenever FirstName is updated to notify UI elements bound to FullName would be updated only if we explicitly call PropertyChanged on FullName property too. In KO this is handled using <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/computedObservables.html">computed observables</a> and is much more elegant.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>6. Commanding</strong></p>

<p>Commanding is how user interactions are bound to actions/functions on ViewModel, which will in turn perform something useful for the user. Like e.g. clicking a button. In KO this is handled using the same <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/click-binding.html">data-bind</a> attribute using key’s corresponding to event handlers. &#8220;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">data-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;click: performSomeAction&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Click me<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>7. Value Converters </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.ivalueconverter(v=vs.110).aspx">IValueConverter</a> interface is to create a converter that can be applied on a Binding to provide custom logic on the data that gets bounded to the UI element. For a similar functionality in KO, there is <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/computedObservables.html">writable computed observable</a> to convert to and from a specific format of data. The read and write function on the computed observable, corresponds to the Convert and ConvertBack functions on IValueConverter on XAML.</p>

<pre class="codepen" data-height="300" data-type="js" data-href="dJhLm" data-user="rahulpnath"><code> </code></pre>

<p>There are a lot of useful resources on the web that are freely available to get started with KnockoutJS. Some of them are listed below</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html">Official Documentation</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://learn.knockoutjs.com/">Learn By Doing</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=knockout+javascript">Videos</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Search?term=knockout#ch9Search">More Videos</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Hope you find this useful to easily understand KnockoutJS, re-applying your XAML knowledge . Do drop in a comment in case you find any other similarities with XAML that I have missed mentioning here and I would be happy to add it in. I am sure I have not covered it completely!

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>It’s been almost an year since I have moved to this custom hosted blog and is nearing its renewal with my current host, Godaddy. Now that Azure has full support for Web Sites which enables you to deploy web applications on a scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure and being a FTE(Full Time Employee), I have the privilege of a free <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-b/">msdn account that offers 150$ free credit on azure</a>, I have decided on to move to Azure for my blog. You could also try this with <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/">a free Azure trial that offers you 200$ credit for all the services</a></p>

<p><strong>Setting up Wordpress</strong> on Azure is very easy and is just a matter of few clicks from the <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com">Management Portal</a>. You can find the detailed steps to get this done <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-php-web-site-gallery/">here</a>. By default Azure Web Sites are installed in the root directory of IIS. To move this into a sub-folder of your choice, you can use any FTP client(FileZilla). The connection details can be obtained from the Management Portal as shown in the below screen shot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/PortalQuickglance.jpg" alt="Portal Quick glance" /> <img src="/images/PortalQuickglance1.jpg" alt="Portal Quick glance 1" /></p>

<p><strong>Mapping your custom domain </strong>to the new wordpress site is about adding a <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-custom-domain-name/">CName record for awverify or www</a> in your Domain dashboard provided by the domain registrar. Once you have the required CName entries you can map the custom domain in the portal using the ‘Manage Domains’ option.</p>

<p><img src="/images/CustomDomain.jpg" alt="Custom Domain" /></p>

<p><strong>Restoring your content </strong>from my current host was easy as I am using <a href="http://vaultpress.com">Vaultpress</a> for my site backup and it provides an option to <a href="http://help.vaultpress.com/restore-to-a-new-site/">backup to a different web site too</a>. If not you could also use <a href="http://www.davebost.com/2013/07/11/moving-a-wordpress-blog-to-windows-azure-transferring-your-content">FTP to move your current site content which is detailed out here</a>. Once the content is restored you would need to update the Wordpress Url and Site address url in the General Settings of your blog dashboard. You could also update this directly on the MySQL database in the <em>wp_options</em> table(<em>home</em> and <em>siteurl</em> property). To connect to the database you would get the connection string details from the portal and you can use <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a> to connect to it. You might have to recheck your permalink setting on the Wordpress dashboard to ensure that it is the same as you were using earlier.</p>

<p><img src="/images/AzureGeneralSettings.jpg" alt="General Settings" /></p>

<p>Now you are up an running your blog on Azure!!</p>

<p><strong>Things to look out for:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1</strong>. Make sure that all your blog links use your custom domain and not <yourdomain>.azurewebsite.net.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>. I had my Jetpack commenting system broken as I had moved the blog to a subdirectory. To correct this you would need to disconnect jetpack from the wordpress account and reconnect it. You can do this from the Wordpress dashboard. If reconnecting throws some error, then connect to your SQL database and delete of the entries that starts with jetpack in the <em>wp_options</em> table.(Make sure you have a db backup before you do this). Reconnecting after that should work fine</p>

<p><strong>3. </strong>If you see any error indicating there is a Redirect loop error, this is mostly because you would be redirecting a no-www request to the www sub domain. In this case make sure that the siteurl and home property in wp_options table also has www in the urls. Otherwise it will keep redirecting itself between no-www and www creating a redirect loop.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:
4. </strong>If you face any error while trying to connect to the azure hosted web site from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=8621">Windows Live Writer</a>(WLW), this most likely is because it uses <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support">xmlrpc.php</a> for publishing posts to the site and this is accessed over the https enpoint. Since https is not setup for the custom domain, accessing xmlrpc.php over https would present you with the below certificate error.</p>

<p><img src="/images/wlw_https_error.jpg" alt="Https error" /></p>

<p>You could either configure your ssl bindings in azure portal, under the <a href="http://ruslany.net/2013/07/how-to-setup-ip-ssl-on-windows-azure-web-sites/">Configure tab under your website</a>. SSL bindings to custom domains can only be used in Basic or Standard mode. If yours is not in basic or standard mode as mine, you can workaround this by either configuring the blog in WLW using your *.azurewebsites.net url.</p>

<p><strong>Azure Plans &amp; Pricing</strong></p>

<p>If you do not have a free account, you might be thinking of the costs that would be really incurred for you to move on to Azure. In short Azure Web Sites is offered in four tiers: <strong>Free</strong>, <strong>Shared (Preview)</strong>, <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Standard</strong>. The pricing details for each of these is available in detail <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/web-sites/">here</a>. To have a custom domain name mapping you would at least need to choose Shared mode. For more information on how to choose the right plan for you, Scott Hanselman has a very good article on <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PennyPinchingInTheCloudWhenDoAzureWebsitesMakeSense.aspx">Penny Pinching in the cloud.</a></p>

<p>Do you plan to move to Azure Web Sites some time soon?

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Recently on a client project, I had a requirement to cache images locally on the phone and then load it from there from subsequent requests. Initially I had plans for custom implementing this using sqlite and custom code. While googling for this, I came across an awesome custom library that solved my problem with just a few lines of code – <a href="https://github.com/artem-zinnatullin/jet-image-loader">JetImageLoader</a> by <a href="https://github.com/artem-zinnatullin">Artem</a>. This is available via nuget, making it easy to install</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/WP-JetImagLoader/0.8.5"><img src="/images/WP-JetImagLoader.png" alt="WP-JetImagLoader" /></a></p>

<p>Integrating this library into any existing project is even easier and is just about using a converter on your Image datatemplate as shown below.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;Image</span> <span class="na">Source=</span><span class="s">&quot;{Binding UserAvatarUrl, Converter={StaticResource JetImageLoaderConverter}}&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You would need to add a custom converter and add this as part of the resource. There is a sample for this on Github where the <a href="https://github.com/artem-zinnatullin/jet-image-loader">project source</a> also lives.</p>

<p>This is all you need to do to have all the images that are bound with the converter to be cached locally on to the Memory and storage. You could also choose to cache it to only memory or storage. Do check this out in case you want to have images cached locally.</p>

<p>The nuget is for Windows 8 library, but there is also a version for <a href="https://github.com/artem-zinnatullin/jet-image-loader/tree/master/JetImageLoader.Wp7">WP7.1 avaialble on Github</a> (which apparently is a pull request from me, indeed my very first on Github that got merged)</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Gadgets, especially mobile phones have always been of interest to me and so is it even today. Its been over two months since I have moved over to Android on Nexus 5. I have been a loyal, hardcore Windows phone fan for over 3 years before that and it did take time to get used to the new operating system. There are still things that I like about Windows phone but there are things that I don’t like too, so I though of giving Android a try. <a href="https://www.google.com/nexus/5/">Nexus 5</a> is one powerful device that is worth every penny for its power packed features and there is no reason not to like it. The <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/10/20/weekend-poll-nexus-5-white-or-black/">White vs Black</a> confusion was there but then I got the White one, as that was the only thing in stock, and after all with a protective cover on, it didn’t matter much.</p>

<p><strong>Things that I love:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Notification</strong> : The one stop place for all notifications is one of the best things that I like moving to Android from Windows phone. A <a href="http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC619123.png">missed toast</a> is always missed until I next decide to open that app in Windows phone or maybe a lock screen notification. But now it is right there on the notification center. (though I have many notifications turned off as part of <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-organized-finding-a-system-to-manage-it-all/">Staying Organized</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Toggle Settings : <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.painless.pc">Toggling settings</a></strong> like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G etc is also top on my likes. There is at least 2 steps required for toggling these settings in Windows phone</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google Now : </strong>I have been googling around for a lot of years and like the way Google Now updates on searches that I have done. Yes I know that we have a privacy problem here, but I have decided to stay on the internet – everything gets tracked here. The <strong>speech recognition</strong> of Google is as best it can get today, best thing being it understands my accent (Indian) pretty much all the time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apps: </strong>I have never been a fan of apps and I rarely used them. Windows phone did have all the major apps, but most of them lacked all the features because of which I had to switch to the web app at times. This in fact made me use the web app always. But Android apps mostly has all the features which makes me use them more. Some of the apps that I use regularly are :</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely">Timely</a> : An awesome alarm clock with the cool Smart Rise feature</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm">Gmail</a> : With all the features of the web app</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.raider">Skype</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.lync15">Lync</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp">Whatsapp</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android">Twitter</a>: Helps me keep connected with my friends, peers and customers</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alienmanfc6.wheresmyandroid">Where&rsquo;s My Droid</a> - Finding a lost phone equivalent on Windows Phone.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle">Kindle</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overdrive.mobile.android.mediaconsole">Overdrive</a> - For my kindle books and audio books</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock">DashClock Widget</a> - For lock screen notifications</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ro.weednet.contactssync">UberSync</a> – To sync facebook contacts and profile pictures to a contact. This is something that is really good in windows phone. Ability to link all social accounts of a person/contact.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Customization: </strong>The level of customization and control that each application gives is enormous that almost everything is configurable. You can mute/turn off notifications on annoying text promotion messages, different color notifications, auto update settings and a lot more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chrome: </strong>This definitely is one another on my top likes. I have been using chrome for a long time and absolutely love the experience even on android. The password sync across devices is cool and so is <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2591582?hl=en">Sync tabs across devices</a>. Bookmarks sync and support for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delicious">Delicious</a> is also good. IE definitely has a long way to go there. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging">developer support</a> for chrome on android is also worth mentioning.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Things that I don’t like and miss:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Jumplist: <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/windows-phone-series-jump-lists/">Jumplists</a></strong> really made navigating through large lists a lot easier on Windows phone. Now I always need to hit the search button and type.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>People Hub: </strong>This was one of the best things of Windows phone, having the ability to <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/people/people-hub?signin=true">link all your social networks</a> into one and have a quick access of all updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nokia Music and Drive: </strong>In fact all the Nokia suite apps were really good and especially these two.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The lists itself explains much of it – <strong>I am liking it a lot. </strong>The android experience on a Nexus device is fast and smooth.</p>

<p><strong>Cases and Covers:</strong></p>

<p>I have been alternating between 2 cases for my Nexus 5 from Spigen and liking them both especially the Neo Hybrid. The white shows of through its transparent back and the overall grip on the phone is very good and comfortable.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00HYA10LC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=B00HYA10LC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21">Spigen Google Nexus 5 Case ULTRA HYBRID</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00EV8Y6QQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=B00EV8Y6QQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21">Spigen Google Nexus 5 Case Protective Neo Hybrid</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>The <strong>battery</strong> backup on the device is pretty good and is lasting for me through a day. I have not yet been on any trips with the phone, so can’t comment on the battery in such situations where generally it lasts lesser. But <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/google-working-nexus-5-battery-drain-fix-affects-all-android-devices-kitkat-qualcomm-chips-1559771">Google has also announced</a> on a battery leak issue for which a fix would be out soon. Hope that would improve it further. I have never been a fan of phone <strong>camera, </strong>since <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/photography-learning-to-click/">I prefer my DSLR</a> for that, but even then for a camera it is pretty decent with lots of options and filters. At times it does come handy and works perfect.</p>

<p>If you are planning to get a new phone and then this is worth considering. If you are already using one then do let know on what you feel about the phone?</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Many applications today provide features that integrate with users location and provide information on a map based on that. In this blog will see how we can use the Bing maps to show a users current location, search for destination and show route to that location. For this will use Bing maps, and you would have to create an account here and create a key that we would be using. Make sure that you read on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/maps/product/terms.html">licensing terms</a> on the api if you are planning to use this in a published application.</p>

<p>To use Maps in windows phone application, you would need to add a reference to ‘<em>Microsoft.Phone.Controls.Maps</em>’ once you create a new Windows phone project. Add the maps control to the application as below to display current location or other map related features.</p>

<p>This adds a map user control to the application and also different layers to the application, on which we would be displaying the pins, routes etc. Anything that gets shown on the map is shown on different layers. Each of these can be cleared, deleted or toggled for visibility making it easy to work on maps.</p>

<p><strong>Track Me</strong></p>

<p>The  first thing that we would want is to track our location, so that we could provide information related to our current location. For this we use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.device.location.geocoordinatewatcher(v=vs.110">GeoCoordinateWatcher</a>.aspx), that provides the location information based in latitude and longitude. Registering for the PositionChanged event will update us whenver the location information related to the user has changed, so that we can update/obtain the real time location of the user if he is on the move. Once we have the user location co-ordinates, we can use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701715.aspx">Location API</a>, to get the location name.</p>

<p><strong>Destination and Routes</strong></p>

<p>Location points are depicted on maps using the Pushpin user control. Now that we have the users location, we need to get the destination where the user wants to go. We have added a simple panorama control where in one of them has a map and the other has the details to enter the destination location. Once the user enters the destination location name, we need to get the co-ordinates of this location. For this we use the Location API again but with a different endpoint. We might get multiple responses for the same location name, for which we add destination pushpins to the map, so that user can select the correct location from the map that he intends to go. On getting confirmation on the destination point, we now need to get the route from the current location to the destination location. A route is nothing but a set of co-ordinates between the start and the destination that the user will have to pass through to reach the final destination. You can use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701705.aspx">Routes API</a> or consume it adding a service reference to <a href="http://dev.virtualearth.net/webservices/v1/routeservice/routeservice.svc/mex">http://dev.virtualearth.net/webservices/v1/routeservice/routeservice.svc/mex</a></p>

<p>The Draw route draws a route line on the RouteLayer on the map, so that the user can see the path that he needs to take to reach his final destination. As the user starts moving the routes are recalcualted and redrawn on the map, so that there is a constant feedback to the user on the path that he is taking. Along with the routes we also get a text direction information that describes the direction in which we need to travel. This can be spoken out to the user so that he need not always look at the mobile to find the next immediate action that he needs to perform. Here I have used the Google translate api</p>

<p>You could add on more features to this using the different location related api’s that are available and provide the user a more enhanced experience.</p>

<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>

<p>Using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/hh202933(v=vs.105">additional tools along with the phone emulator</a>.aspx), you can simulate location changes and also be at any location without actually being there and test. The emulator also provides a lot of functionality to simulate movement along a specific route and fire location changes in fixed amount of time etc, that come handy while testing.

<p>You could also install it on to a phone and dash out to test it for yourself in your real-time location and reach the coffee-shop faster!. Find the sample code <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/SimpleGPS">here</a> and feel free to use it.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>With lots of devices and operating systems out there, developing a native application for each of these platforms might not always be an option for many businesses, because of the time, effort and money that would be required to be on all platforms. <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> is one option that could be explored in this case, which helps to develop hybrid applications that can exists on a <a href="http://phonegap.com/about/feature/">variety of platforms</a> integrating with platform specific features. <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a> is what powers PhoneGap and is free and open source under the <a href="http://phonegap.com/about/license/">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>.</p>

<p>Setting up PhoneGap is pretty easy and direct with its integration with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. Lets take a look on how to setup our project from scratch.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a></p></li>
<li><p>Install PhoneGap using node.js</p>

<p> <strong><em>npm install –g phonegap</em></strong></p>

<p> npm is the official node package manager</p>

<p> -g installs the package in global scope.If you face any error while installing the package(since I happened to, I guess because I closed the console while it was installing the first time) you can try following the below steps, which helped me solve it.</p>

<p> <strong>            npm list –g</strong></p>

<p> If the above step shows that there is a <em>unmet dependency phonegap</em>, then you could follow the below steps</p>

<p> <strong>            npm rm phonegap</strong></p>

<p> <strong>            npm cache clear</strong></p>

<p> Try installing PhoneGap again using <em>npm install –g phonegap</em></p></li>
<li><p>Install Cordova
<strong>npm install –g cordova</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Now we have everything setup for PhoneGap project. Lets create the project. Navigate to your project root folder and create a project.</p>

<p> <strong>phonegap create <appname></strong></p>

<p> This will create the basic folder structure for your PhoneGap project which looks like below.</p>

<p> <img class="left" src="/images/cordova_folder_structure.png" alt="cordova_folder_structure" /></p>

<p> <strong>.cordova: </strong>This directory contains files related to cordova.</p>

<p> <strong>merges: </strong>This directory contains platform specific assets. A sub-directory for each platform is created inside here, whenever  a new platform is created. This sub-directory mirrors the structure of the <em>www </em>directory, which allows to add platform specific files to appropriate folders.</p>

<p> <strong>platforms: </strong>This directory contains native code for each of the <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_platforms_index.md.html">supported platforms</a>. By default this is empty and we need to add the required platforms, which we will see later.</p>

<p> <strong>plugins: </strong>This directory contains the <a href="https://build.phonegap.com/plugins">plugins</a> that provide extra support to interface with each of the native platforms.</p>

<p> <strong>www: </strong>This directory contains the primary files that is required for your project/application. This gets copied into each of the platform specific projects in <em>platforms </em>folder whenever a build is performed. So this is where your core development would happen and all your cross-platform code would live in.</p></li>
<li><p>Lets now create a native project, for windows phone.</p>

<p> <strong>cordova platform add wp8</strong></p>

<p> This will add a wp8 folder inside <em>platforms </em>and also <em>merges. </em>The one in platforms will have the native project setup with all the files in <em>www</em> folder copied into it. You can open up the sln file in Visual Studio and build and run. We have the application up and running on our first platform!
 Lets add in some code so that it makes sense as an application. We will stick on with our usual 500px api and show off some beautiful pictures. I have added jquery from nuget in Visual studio and also updated the files to show pictures from 500px, which I would not be explaining here as it is just some html/js/css..(Updated files in www folder can later be copied into the root <em>www </em>folder later. Need to figure out the correct way on how to go about this. In case you know how, please do leave a comment. Would be more than happy to learn.)</p></li>
<li><p>Once we copy out the updated files in platform specific <em>www </em>folder into root www folder we can go ahead and add android platform.</p>

<p> <strong>cordova platform add android</strong></p>

<p> This creates an android folder inside <em>platforms</em> and <em>merges</em> folder. You can open up the project in your IDE(<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a>, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> or <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">Android Studio</a> etc) for android, build and run. We have the application up and running also on the second platform!
 For android you would need to make sure the config files are updated with the required permissions for accessing internet and also to enable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">CORS</a>. By default internet permissions are enabled, you would only have to update the config for cors(<em>origin header</em>) as it defaults to ‘<em>127.0.0.1*</em>’. I have updated this to just ‘*’, inside <strong><em>res/xml/config.xml </em></strong>(since there is one config.xml inside assets/www folder too).If you are new to android platform, which I was then you can check out here on <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/setting-up-the-development-environment-for-phonegap-on-android/">Setting up the development environment for phonegap on android</a>.
 At times I did have the Android emulator not moving past the &lsquo;<em>Connecting to Device</em>&rsquo; screen while running the application. I just killed all the emulators and started a fresh one from AVD (Android Virtual Device) Manager, unchecking &lsquo;launch from snapshot&rsquo; and &lsquo;save to snapshot&rsquo; options.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>With PhoneGap/Cordova, you can see how easy it is to have an app in various platforms of your choice. We have not seen on how to utilize any of the platform specific features of devices using PhoneGap, but I am sure that you should be able to figure out from here, now that you have all that you need up and running.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Cordova_WP.jpg" alt="Cordova_WP" />
<img src="/images/Cordova_Android.jpg" alt="Cordova_Android" /></p>

<p>The source code for the sample is available <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/GettingStartedOnPhoneGap">here</a>. Don’t forget to update the <a href="http://developers.500px.com/">api key for 500px</a> before you run the application.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I have been working on Microsoft stack for over a long time, in fact almost my entire career. Now that with all the platforms out there and cross platform being a very important factor in any application development, knowing about other platforms and developing for them is very important . Since I have had some prior experience on Java, I thought of ramping back on it so that I could also explore the Android operating system.</p>

<p>Setting up Java and choosing an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> was always confusing for me and so is it now. For .Net it was, is and always will be <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio</a> and the setup experience is seamless. For a person in the .net world moving into java would take some time in setting up the environment, and getting used to the IDE’s. Personally I feel that none of the java IDE’s matches the experience and features provided by Visual Studio - but that might be just me. But lets be happy with what we have and start setting up our development environment.</p>

<ul>
<li><p> <strong>Download</strong> the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">Java SDK</a>. I have chosen to download the latest one as on writing this blog, as I did not have any reason not to. If you have a specific need to have a particular java version then you should get that. Install it into the appropriate location (e.g. <em>C:\Program Files\java\jdk1.7</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Set JAVA_HOME</strong> in the system environment variables.
Right Click on MyComputer –> Properties –>Advanced System Settings –> Environment Variables
Under System Variables, add a new variable by clicking New and entering <em>Variable Name </em>as JAVA_HOME and <em>Variable value</em> as the path to the root jdk folder installed in previous step.(<em>C:\Program Files\java\jdk1.7</em>). Save the changes.
To see if this has been saved you can verify by opening a command prompt and typing in <em>echo %JAVA_HOME%, </em>which should echo out the path set above.</p></li>
<li><p>Update <strong>PATH </strong>to include java path too, so that this can be executed from anywhere, without knowing the full path of the java compiler.
Under system variables there would already be a variable with name <em>path </em>(if not add it), to which you can append the java path. Java is in the bin folder under the root folder, so append “<em>;%JAVA_HOME%/bin;</em>” to the path variable. Save and close.
To check if this is successfully setup, open up command prompt and type in java. You should see usage information help for java.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Installing ANT. </strong>Download <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant library</a> and copy/install into a suitable location. Ant is used in the build of java applications and is more comparable to msbuild in .net.</p></li>
<li><p>Set <strong>ANT_HOME </strong>and<strong> PATH </strong>like we set for Java. Should be easy for you now.</p></li>
<li><p>Download and install <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android SDK</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Set <strong>ANDROID_HOME </strong>to the android sdk root folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Set <strong>PATH </strong>for android tools(<em>%ANDROID_HOME%\tools;</em>) and platform-tools<em>(%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools;</em>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Download an IDE</strong>. <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a>, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ Community Edition</a> , <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">Android Studio</a> are all freely available IDE’s that you can choose from. Android studio is based on IntelliJ IDEA. I chose to use IntelliJ for now for no specific reason.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Now you are all setup for starting your development with PhoneGap on Android . Hope this helps you to quick start your development.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>In our busy lives, with multiple roles to play at home and work, everyone needs to have some kind of system to keep things organized and stay on top - <strong><em>to have control</em>. </strong>I&rsquo;ve been always amazed on how my father stays organized with all the things with his to-do list paper calendar and the energy with which he gets things done. Apart from his not-so-optimized short trips on the two-wheeler(which he does because he enjoys it) in getting things done across the town, that is what I have always wanted to attain.</p>

<p>I have always tried the pen-paper method to keep track of things to get done, but somehow I could never keep up with it. I always lost track of it as most of my work is <strong>not <em>track able with paper</em></strong>. Most of my work is done using a computer and I thought something that best suites me would be some tool that is right in my computer. I have tried with a variety of tasks application and some of them are pretty good in how it organizes tasks. But again it yet did not integrate into my life that easily, as there was always an overhead of entering tasks.</p>

<blockquote><p>Contemplating over why all these systems itself was an overhead, one thing that I have realized that I was always trying to live two lives - <strong>personal and official</strong>, with these systems.</p></blockquote>

<p>Major part of my day is spend at office where work mostly comes over email. Keeping track of it on a different task list manager or paper is really an overhead. So mostly I ended my leaving my office tasks in my mails itself and only tried to manage my personal tasks on the tool. This is why I <em>was living two lives</em>. There were two systems of management(or even more as bugs are assigned in <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/tfs-overview-vs.aspx">Visual Studio TFS</a>) which by itself made tasks management an overhead and unmanageable.</p>

<p>After a  lot of reading and researching around the common productivity tools and systems finally I reached back to what I have been using day in and day out – <strong><em>Outlook. </em></strong>Outlook is more than a mere mailbox management tool. It has a lot of features that is built into it which is seldom used and overlooked upon. One advantage with outlook is that it is available everywhere – desktop, web, tablet and phone.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/Outlook_folders_productivity.png" alt="Outlook_folders_productivity" /></p>

<p>Most of us, even me used to just use flags on messages to indicate the messages that I had to take actions on. But this would soon turn out unmanageable, as it is hard to prioritize out from a single large list. Outlook has an important feature of <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/outlook-help/create-and-assign-color-categories-HA010217901.aspx">categorization</a> and also <a href="http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/bb899478.aspx">folderization</a>. Either of this feature can be used to maximize the way in which we manage tasks.</p>

<p>I have chosen to use folders for the only reason that it is easier to sync folders on to my mobile, than categorized tasks, for which I would again need another application. As mentioned in the <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0142000280/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=0142000280&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21">Getting Things Done</a>, by David Allen I have created various folders to categorize the tasks that come in</p>

<p><strong>.NextActions:</strong>  This holds the immediate next actions that I need to do. I further set a <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/outlook-help/flag-an-item-for-follow-up-HA010355003.aspx">flag date</a> to further prioritize them within the list.
<strong>.WaitingFor: </strong>This holds the items that I am waiting for somebody else to reply or something that I have delegated to someone else for action.(This is probably a NextAction on some one else’s list)
<strong>.TalkTo: </strong>These are things that I need to talk to people in person or over phone.
<strong>.References: </strong>These are reference documents that would be useful.
<strong>@Future: </strong>This contains tasks that needs to be done in the future, which might be in the next week. This would soon go into the .NextActions.
<strong>@Blog: </strong>These contain activities I need to do maintain this blog</p>

<p>And many of such folders that makes sense to me. You should create folders that makes sense to you.So all my official and personal tasks are now managed in my mailbox. For any tasks that do not come over a mail, I send a mail to myself.</p>

<p><strong>Reaching Zero Inbox</strong></p>

<p>Having a <a href="http://inboxzero.com/">zero mail inbox</a> is a very important thing – but not at any given point of time. Mails definitely can wait some time, before you take action on them. Allocate time to check mails and try to follow it. Once you check mails allocate them into the various folders that you already have. If it is something that you can answer to in less than a few minutes then do that immediately than allocating them to a folder and then picking it up from there. For anything else allocate them to different folders and act upon them later as per their priority. Create calendar entries/reminders only if it is strictly time bound, which has to happen at a specific time or date, like birthdays, booking time etc.</p>

<p>Create meaningful <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/outlook-help/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-HA010355682.aspx">mail rules</a> so that you get to see what is urgent/important first. You need not scan all mail rule folders at all times. Mails that directly are addressed to you, mostly would need your attention. So the first rule would be to have messages that are directly addressed to you, to come to your inbox. Messages that you are <em>cc’ed</em>  in are mostly for information and should go to a different folder(Inbox-cc). But there are high chances that people who send messages  to you might not take a good look on when replying to messages in which field you are in. I have seen this, where it was directly addressed to me in the subject, but was cc’ed. But at least make sure you do not make this mistake. Always check the to and cc fields before sending/replying to mail. All other mails that reached me because I am in certain distribution lists goes into specific folders, which I scan only once a day.</p>

<p>Create a mail scanning process for yourself, whatever works for you. But try to stick to it.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Attention</strong></p>

<p>The biggest thing for staying productive and organized is attention management than time management. Even if you have scheduled your time for tasks, if you don&rsquo;t have the attention required then there is no point in managing your time. It is easy to manage your attention. Find things that distracts you and try to avoid them. One of the main thing in today&rsquo;s world that distracts us the most is – <strong>push notifications</strong>. Turn them off.Yes your heard it right. Turn them off right now. There is nothing that important coming over those notifications that is more important than keeping your attention to what you want. Notifications should be only for phone calls if you feel them important, because I do. I keep my internet turned on, as I would still want to have emails, tweets or other updates to be still updated onto my phone when I need them.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Turn off  Push Notifications</strong>. This is really going to help you manage your attention.</p></blockquote>

<p>Try to forcefully keep your attention to the task at hand. You can try out <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">The Pomodoro Technique</a>. There are many apps for the phone that will work as a timer for the technique. I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.phlam.android.clockworktomato&amp;hl=en">Clockwork Tomato</a> - Yes for some time I am on an android Nexus5.</p>

<p>Plan your day so that you have a goal to achieve everyday, that just reacting to mails and working on someone else’s priorities. Don’t start your checking mails in the morning immediately after getting up. Have fixed times for checking mails, but definitely not the first thing in the morning.It might be hard for couple of days but it is only a matter of getting used to. You will definitely see a difference once you start following it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Stop checking your mails the first thing in the morning immediately after getting up.</p></blockquote>

<p>Its not been long since I have started to follow this, but I felt interesting enough to share this if it helps someone who is also searching for tools and methodologies to keep yourself productive and manage your tasks and responsibilities. There are a lot of resources that has inspired into this process and would be wrong to not mention it here</p>
