  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>For all those who are wondering what this stars are,please go through my first <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/do-stars-count/">post</a> on this.</p>

<p>Casually browsing through my mails today morning,I found a mail with the subject stating,&lsquo;<em>Your online community contributions have been recognized by Microsoft</em>&rsquo;,informing me that I have won the Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoftcommunitycontributor.com/">Community Contributor Award</a>.Really excited to have the first award for a technical contribution,and that too from Microsoft.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mcca_rahulpnath.png" alt="Microsoft Community Contributor Award Certificate for Rahul P Nath" /></p>

<p>I appreciate Microsoft for promoting community contributors and rewarding them.Personally,I enjoy contributing in communities as I find it one another way to learn.I used not just reply to questions that I knew,but often ended up creating a sample application and finding out the solution first,which has helped me a lot in learning.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Microsoft and all the community members and people who would  have nominated me for this award.</p>

<p>Stars Do Count sometimes :)</p>

<p>edit: The award would be retired as now I am an Microsoft employee.I had intimated them on this ,as I guess somehow their records missed that I am their employee :).So got the mail confirmation today..award is retired .Still it&rsquo;s a good feeling in having achieved it at the first place.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/wcf-simplified/" itemprop="url">WCF Simplified </a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Windows Communication Foundation(WCF) is basically a framework that assists in building  service oriented applications.I really felt it to be complicated in the early days that I got exposed to it,and always tried to keep away from it.But the more I tried to keep away,the more closer I needed to be with it(not sure whether that would be another of Murphy&rsquo;s law).So finally got to sit with a book for couple of days and this is what I came out  with.</p>

<p><em>WCF is all about exposing CLR types as services and consuming services as CLR types</em></p>

<p>WCF brings together all the previous distributed programming models that were there, like ASMX,remoting,MSMQ making everyones life easier.You get the power of all previous technologies just by changing a set of configurations in a config file.The keywords in WCF is ABC which itself can be termed Endpoint.Endpoint is nothing but the A(Address),B(Binding) and C(Contract) put together.So now what is this ABC.(I would be relating this to you and explaining as you yourself is a &lsquo;service&rsquo;  in one way or the other.You provide a service to your family,friends,employer,government etc.)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong>ddress</li>
</ul>


<p>This is nothing but the address where your service would be located and would also tell the transportation mechanism that would be used like HTTP,TCP,Peer Network,IPC,MSMQ.With respect to,&lsquo;<em>you as a service</em>&rsquo;,this is exactly the address where one  can find you so that a consumer of your service can get the service that you provide.This can be your mail-id,phone number or house address,which also shows the mode of communication,depending on the kind of consumer that you are serving.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>B</strong>inding</li>
</ul>


<p>It is just a set of grouped combinations of transport protocol,encoding of the message ,security, reliability,transaction ,interoperability etc.Again with regards to &lsquo;<em>you as a service</em>&rsquo;,this can be seen as the langugae accent,how securely the information came on to you and things like that.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>C</strong>ontract</li>
</ul>


<p>This just specifies what the service does.This specifies what functionalities the service provides and also the way the data can be passed in and given out.With respect to <em>&lsquo;you as a service</em>&rsquo; this can be seen as the functionalities/activities that you do,the language in which that you can communicate(Say Engligh,French etc).Contracts in WCF are basically of 4 types,Service contract,Data contract,Fault contract and Message contract.Service contract specifies the set of functionalities that the service provides,Data contract specifies the way the data is exchanged,Fault contract specifies how faults/exceptions would be communicated out and Message contract specifies the format of  the message that is actually send(this is used very rarely,unless there is a specific structure that is to followed).Contracts aim at supporting interoperability and so it is to be expressed in a technology independent way.</p>

<p>Another key word that might come in between to confuse you more would be Channels.Now this is nothing but,something related to Binding.Since in a binding you specify different things like security,encoding and what not,each of these specific things are handled in its on layer/channel.You can see that there is something called Channel Stack,i.e. a stack of  different classes,each providing a discrete set of functionality.This whole stack would in turn make up your binding.Based on the you choose binding different channels would be stacked up together,just like you have different burgers with different layers of toppings :).As in burgers,you always have the option of making a custom binding too.</p>

<p>Any message that comes in to this channel stack,gets acted upon by different channels providing it/wrapping the message with security,reliability,transaction etc ,so that it comes out of the stack with all the features applied.So this takes away all the extra effort,that otherwise you would have had to do manually.This wrapping happens on the sending side and unwrapping happens on the receiving side.Because of this kind of architecture,WCF&rsquo;s architecture is also called &lsquo;<em>interception-based</em>&rsquo; architecture,as at each point it is intercepted and injected with additional features.</p>

<p>WCF has an extensible model.This means that at any place you can plugin your own custom implementations if required .<em><strong>System.ServiceModel</strong></em> is the one single namespace that turns life in the distributed world elegant and simple.So do explore it and start thinking everything around you as a service,so that you could relate things more to WCF :)</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Most of the people switching to WPF,got to understand the fact the WPF tries to target one major problem of the technologies that existed before, which was tight coupling of the design and the behaviour.WPF has a ‘<em>lookless control model</em>’,and that simply means that the look and feel of the control is completely separated from the behaviour of the  control.And that is where the whole concept of XAML comes in,which does its part of defining the visual representation.</p>

<p>But still many people move on to WPF from older technologies fail to absorb this core approach.Mostly this happens when the look of something is to be dynamically generated.Say in the case of a Listbox bound to a itemssource.As far as the item is to be displayed in pure text everything goes fine.People figure out that the <em>DisplayMemberPath</em> has to be set to the property that they want to be displayed in the listbox.
 &#8220;` csharp
 private void Window_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
          listBox1.ItemsSource = PopulateEmployees();
        }</p>

<pre><code>    private static List&lt;Employee&gt; PopulateEmployees()
    {
        List&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new List&lt;Employee&gt;();
        Employee emp;
        for int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        {
            emp = new Employee()
            {
                FirstName = "Name",
                LastName = i.ToString(),
                Id = i
            };
            employees.Add(emp);
        }
        return employees;
    }
}

class Employee
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

   public string LastName { get; set; }

    public int&lt;/span&gt; Id { get; set; }
}
```
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/binding_displaymemberpath.jpg" alt="binding displaymemberpath" /></p>

<p>But the scenario changes when the item to be displayed has to be more informative.Say you need a image to come up with some text,or maybe a button/checkbox etc.Now people tend to shift to the older approaches of creating the listbox items display from code.As that’s how it had been done before and also that seems easier.</p>

<p>The code changes to something similar to shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/binding_code_behind.jpg" alt="binding code behind" /></p>

<p>Or another approach might be slightly better than this one,by creating a user control to hold this data and then create the User control in the code behind and then add that to the listbox items.</p>

<p>This is where people tend to loose focus of the real power of WPF ..<strong>Templating</strong>.</p>

<p>All this code can be easily replaced and also clearly separate that UI details from the behaviour.The property that&rsquo;s the key here is <em>ItemTemplate,</em>and this would how the new code look like.</p>

<p><img src="/images/binding_data_template.jpg" alt="binding data template" /></p>

<p>And the code in the behind all vanishes,and is as simple in our first case,by just setting up the listbox1’s ItemsSource.</p>

<p>That is the power of templating and clearly separates the UI aspect from code. Any ItemsControl will have the property ItemTemplate that is to be set to the way you want the data to be displayed.If the display is complex in itself then you can move those into a separate user control and create  that user control  as the ItemTemplate.Anytime you want to change the way your control looks you just need to change in the xaml,clearly bringing in the decoupling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Every time one of my friends asks,&lsquo;<em>Hey how to start off with WPF</em>&rsquo;,I think of putting up a post,so that I could easily direct them and say,&lsquo;<em>Hey check out my post in my blog</em>&rsquo;.Maybe from the next time I would :)</p>

<p>There are a lot of blogs that describes on how to Kick start WPF,and this is my version of it.</p>

<p>WPF is just like any other technology that you would love to learn,except for the fact that not all technologies are cool..but WPF really is and you would enjoy every bit learning it.</p>

<p>Books would be the best source to kick start the learning,as the topics would be covered in a organized manner,so that you wouldn&rsquo;t need to hunt down the meaning of something new that you would come across.Some suggested books on WPF are</p>

<p>There are a lot of other books too that are good,but personally I found this as good for beginners.</p>

<p>Some of the must know things as far as WPF is concerned would be its Layout mechanism(Mathew&rsquo;s book gives a good explanation of that),Binding mechanism(Adams book should be good for that ).Also do understand the concept of Resources,Styles and Templates  if you would be playing the role of UX developer :).Otherwise also those are good to know concepts.</p>

<p>As with any technology developing a &lsquo;Hello World&rsquo; kind of application is easy.Its in about understanding the best practices,patterns that are best supported and implementing things the way they were actually meant to be.Same holds true for WPF too :)MVVM is one such pattern thats most talked about in WPF.There is a very good <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx/">article</a> by Josh Smith.There is also a book by him,Advanced MVVM,if you are interested in detail.Also do check out <a href="http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/">Prism </a>that is by the Microsoft P&amp;P team.It provides a very good guidance on how to go about developing applications.</p>

<p>You would also find lots of videos in <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/wpf">channel9</a>,which should also be a good source of information.</p>

<p>Blogs are another source of information,and lots of people seems to be in love with WPF,including me :)Almost all the major contributors to WPF are part of <a href="http://wpfdisciples.wordpress.com/">WPF disciples</a>,from which you can easily navigate to their respective blogs.</p>

<p>For anything else there is always the <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en/wpf/threads/">MSDN forum</a>,with people all round the world ready to answer your questions.Feel free to post any specific doubts that you come across.</p>

<p>Finally all reading and no implementing makes little use.So get a Visual Studio up and running and try things side by side..and soon you would find yourself good in WPF :)</p>

<p>Welcome to WPF :)</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>It&rsquo;s not been that long that I&rsquo;ve been into the IT servicing industry.But still the learning curve I&rsquo;ve had during the  past few years has been dramatic.The first time I was put into a &lsquo;<em>live client facing project</em>&rsquo; was almost one year after my industry entry.</p>

<p>Now what is the key takeaway from this post?</p>

<p>Nothing much maybe for a seasoned IT developer/professional.I am just trying to explain out what to look out for when developing an enterprise application as a beginner.How to approach things. Definitely its not like building an application that you might be used to creating during your college days(if at all you were ,coz I used not :) ).I was puzzled on where to start ,how to approach things,whats the right way.Here&rsquo;s what I figured out for my questions through my experiences.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the disclamer&hellip;.All views are just that of mine and only mine,just in case &hellip;.. :)</p>

<p>First thing I understood is there is nothing like &lsquo;<em>perfect resource</em>&rsquo; for a project.It&rsquo;s just that resources are molded to fit the requirement and the technologies.So you have to live with it and learn things the hard way.Try to get a view of things from a higher altitude,which means above technology.Try to understand the concept on which things are based on,rather than on how to use the particular implementation of a concept.For example a person working on .net should be flexible enough to move on to Java or any other OO(Object Oriented) language(this one is a personal experience again ).So trying to relate you learnings to OO concepts and seeing how it is implemented in .net would make you easily jump to a different language.Because you know what exactly to look out for there too.</p>

<p>On an implementation level,the process model that we had followed for the project,was waterfall,which by itself created a lot of problems on the requirement side.As the model advocates there was a big &lsquo;<em>upfront design</em>&rsquo; phase ,the output of which had very little resemblance to what came out in the end.But still it did exist with the key players being those like me,who were all just puzzled as I was,on what to do.Here I would like to mention the things that I felt towards the end of implementation,that I felt that I should have done during this phase.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Should have known/read of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> ,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)">GRASP</a> principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Awareness of certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)">design patterns</a> would have helped to create a better design.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Different approaches might be taken to tackle the same problem.But always make sure that the common cross cutting concerns are handled in a centralized manner.This includes things like exception handling,error logging,data validation,transaction and many other things.Handling this in a centralized manner makes things easier for you and targeting changes relating to any of these in an elegant,simple manner.The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc467894.aspx">Enterprise Library</a> is one such example which assists in the .net world.You could probably come up with your own frameworks.But always make sure you have,because I have learned this too..the hard way.</p>

<p>Refactoring,improving the design of the code after it has been written,is one process that any developer should start doing at his level,and better if implemented at a team level too.This really helps to remove &lsquo;smelly code&rsquo; and also improve your design.It&rsquo;s true that most developers switch job when they start hating ,see their own code &lsquo;<em>rot</em>&rsquo;.Recheck the disclaimer, if you don&rsquo;t agree.This can be avoided to some extent by refactoring I guess,An added advantage to refactoring maybe :)</p>

<p>Presentation layer/UI layer is the one part that people tend to develop a bit fast,because they want to see something of their own efforts.Make sure you have a architectural pattern targeting this like MVC,PM,MVP,MVVM etc.This is really important,again something  learnt the hard way.Don&rsquo;t just go ahead the &lsquo;<em>drag&#8217;n drop-double click-write code</em>&rsquo; way which is highly supported in Visual Studio(for .net) or any other IDE&rsquo;s.This seems easy to start with,but as time and code starts growing it becomes a pain.Make sure your logics are neatly separated and highly re-used.UI is one part where re usability comes down,and this is mostly because of the lack of proper use of architectural patterns as mentioned above.</p>

<p>Through my experiences,I learned that there is no such &lsquo;<em>one right way</em>&rsquo; of doing things,but its in how well you do things the way that you do matters.It&rsquo;s in how well you manage your dependencies that matter in the last,and thats what counts.Even now,having had an experience in a project,I am no good in this.Its just that I have learned some of the ways that things should not be done.</p>

<p>Some of the books that I found very helpful,though I have not read all cover-to-cover are :</p>

</ol>


<p>Some of these books are technology specific,but most of them are not.Its just gives an approach to doing things,just using a technology as a medium of explaining.</p>

<p>Not sure whether this post would really target all audience,but if I had got to read some vague tips like this,the first time I face an enterprise project,it would have helped better,better in the sense,to make less mistakes maybe :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Just a though on a new mail attachment way :).</p>

<p>What if we could attach existing attachments in our mailbox to new mails that we want to send.Forwarding the mail that had the attachment might not be a good solution in many a cases.</p>

<p>The key point here is that attachments should be like a resource,that can be shared across mails,that can be deleted edited or updated.</p>

<p>There could be a small widget showing all attachments that you have in your mailbox,from which you can add whatever you want to your current mail.</p>

<p>I think this would be a cool feature in the present email system.</p>

<p>You would not end up uploading the same file again and again :)</p>

<p>Feel free to comment on this idea ::)</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Mobile phones should be always responsive,highly responsive infact.If it&rsquo;s not responding within 10 to 15 seconds,the users hits the switch off button or removes the battery to reset the phone&hellip;.I have done this many a times.</p>

<p>The WP7 application model allows only 1 application to be running at a time.But its not that bad that you have to always start from the beginning of an app if you switch away from it.Whenever you switch away from an app,it just goes into a hibernation mode,tombstoning to be more precise.Whenever a user switches between applications,the phone activates and deactivates the applications.Events are raised to notify this activating and deactivating so that the developers can handle them and maintain the state of the application between switches,as if it was just back there running.A user may also explicitly close down an application by pressing the back button on the device at the first page of the application.</p>

<p>On start of a new instance of an application,which happens whenever an application is opened other than by switching to it using the back button,a launching event is raised after which the application moves on into the running state.It&#8217;s advised not to perform any time consuming activities in the Launching event handler,as any latency of more than 10 seconds causes the application to be bought down by the phone.So any IsolatedStorage access is recommended to be done after the application is up and running,making the app more responsive,which is our primary goal.On normal close the application raises a Closing event,where you might be saving persistent data to the IsolatedStorage.Data relating to a particular instance of application need not be saved here as the only way now to start the application is coming right from the beginning,raising the Launching even all over again.Again saving to the IsolatedStorage can be a little tricky.If it takes more than 10 seconds,the application will be terminated forcefully.The key here is that any data to be persisted should be done as and when you have the data and in a asynchronous manner.The earlier this happens the better it is for your application.Otherwise you may run into forceful termination of your application and loosing data and thereby decreasing you application&#8217;s reliability and use.</p>

<p>Tombstoning opens up a whole new path for the application lifecylcle,introducing additional two events,Activated and Deactivated.The State Dictionary maintained by the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.phone.shell.phoneapplicationservice(v=VS.92).aspx">PhoneApplicationService</a>(which also provides all the above mentioned events) is kept as is between application switches.That is whatever is saved in that before deactivating the app will be available after the application is activated.This is how maintaining application state is achieved between application switches.On start of a new application instance the State Dictionary would be empty.Data that is required for just a particular application instance goes into the State Dictionary and the data that is required for all application instances gets saved into the IsolatedStorage.Applications may get tombstoned due to many reasons.It maybe due to user hitting the start button when in an application,launching choosers or launchers(in some cases of doesn&rsquo;t get tombstoned,but its always better to handle for this),due to phone going into idle state(which again can be handled).</p>

<p>The below diagram,as from msdn, gives the complete picture of the application model.</p>

<p><img src="/images/wp7_application_model.png" alt="wp7 application model" /></p>

<p>Getting a good idea of the application model is important to build highly responsive,reliable application for the Windows Phone 7.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Need not much of an explanation I guess.
The title has it all&hellip;.
&hellip;.a C# API for searching images from google.
Works on Regex for matching the image URL from the HTML returned for the image tag search.This might stop working anytime google changes the formatting.
Even the current regex is not returning all the images from a page.Working on that though..would be fixed in the next release<em>.
I started this to try the AsynEnumerator from <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/Resources/Downloads">PowerThreading </a>Library by Wintellect.
I guess i&rsquo;ve not understood it fully and there is an overuse of it in this version..that too would be looked into the next release</em>.</p>

<p>Download VS2010 source <a href="http://rahulpnath.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/imagesearch_2010.jpg">code</a> (right click and save link as and  rename to .rar)
Download VS2008 source <a href="http://rahulpnath.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/imagesearch_2008.jpg">code</a> (right click and save link as and  rename to .rar)</p>

<p>PS: Since the search results format is changing often the code might not work sometimes.Doing my best to keep it updated and working.Do check the comments too to see if the regex match string is changed.Sometimes I might not get time to update the solution,but would just leave a comment.Latest comment should be the best to match with :)</p>
