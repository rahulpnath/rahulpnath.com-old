      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/is-code-coverage-a-lie/" itemprop="url">Is Code Coverage a Lie?</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Code Coverage has been one of the important things that was always there on a daily build report and a number that managers were both interested and worried about. This has been the same for all projects that I had worked on, across various organizations. Various tools support measuring coverage and can be included as part of the build reports, which essentially indicates the percentage of source code that is covered by &lsquo;unit tests&rsquo;. A higher percentage obviously indicates a better tested code and more stable one is what one would expect, as that would be the sole purpose of measuring this. But how far is this true? Is a code with higher test percentage one with lesser bugs? Does 100% indicate that it is totally bug free or is this a total wrong way of seeing that number?</p>

<h3>What is Code Coverage and How is it Measured?</h3>

<p>Code Coverage indicates the percentage of code that has been covered by at least one or more tests in your test suite. So if you have a simple function like the one shown below, which just divides two numbers and if you have one test that invokes that function, then you have a code coverage of 100%. When using Visual studio tests (as that is what I have used to depict the below one), code coverage is measured either based on blocks of code or based on lines of code.</p>

<ul>
<li><h4>Block-based statement coverage</h4>

<p>For the purposes of the tools, a block is defined as a sequence of instructions that have a single entry point and a single exit point. Exit points include branch instructions, a function call, a return instruction, or, for managed code, a throw instruction.</p></li>
<li><h4>Line-based coverage</h4>

<p>For line-based coverage, the tools identify all of the blocks that make up a line and then use this information to determine the level of coverage for the line. If all of the blocks that make up the line are covered, then the tools report that the line is covered. If no blocks in the line are covered, then the tools report that the line is not covered. If some, but not all, of the blocks in the line are covered, then the tools report that the line is partially covered.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In the below case we have both 100% as there is only one line and one block and the test covers both. So should managers be happy with this code, since it has 100% coverage? Maybe they are, but ask the developers, they definitely are not, or probably they are if at the first place they wrote the tests for the sake of the report and since the managers are happy they too are. But is this what we should strive for - definitely not!</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Visual Studio Code Coverage" src="/images/code_coverage.PNG" /></p>

<h3>Trustworthy Unit Tests</h3>

<blockquote><p>Unit tests should be like a parachute - trustworthy. You are not going to jump out from an airplane with one that you know is faulty.</p></blockquote>

<p>Having unit tests that are run once in a while or just for the build reports or when the manager is at your back, are a complete waste of time. A set of faulty tests do more harm than having none, as it might give wrong judgment of the code. From the above code you can definitely find that though the coverage is 100%, the code would simply fail when a value of 0 is passed for &lsquo;b&rsquo;, and it is highly likely that this would happen too.</p>

<blockquote><p>If unit tests are written just to meet the code coverage number on a report, then I would rather fake the report than writing the tests</p></blockquote>

<p>Unit Tests really make sense only when you write them following &lsquo;<a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd">The Three Rules of TDD</a>&rsquo; or at the very least you have tests associated with every change that you make and also you make sure that we run the entire test suite before a check-in to make sure that you have broken nothing with your changes. Only when there is such &lsquo;trustworthiness&rsquo; in the tests, does it make sense to have them in the first place and not for any number on a report.</p>

<h3>How should we really see that number on the report?</h3>

<p>Now that we have seen it is all about having trustworthy tests and not about reaching a targeted number for a report, what should we really use this Code coverage report data for?</p>

<ol>
<li>If you are less than 100% it clearly indicates that there are areas of your application that is not tested. You would really want to cross check if that is an intended miss or if there is something that is actually missing and add in some more tests to be covered better.</li>
<li>When refactoring code, you can always make sure that you don&rsquo;t go back on the coverage number that you started with, so as to ensure that you have not introduced untested code into the system.</li>
<li>When cleaning up tests a drop in the coverage number clearly indicates that you have actually removed some valid and non-redundant tests.</li>
</ol>


<p>So the next time you add in a test, think why you are doing it. Is it for the report or for the application that is getting developed. Lets all <a href="https://vimeo.com/43536488">strive to be really professional</a> in what we are doing and not just hide behind some numbers. Let the number be seen for what it is - nothing less and nothing more!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><blockquote><p>Please check <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">here</a> for scripts using the latest PowerShell cmdlets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the applications today needs to use some kind of sensitive information like a database connection-string, api secret or passwords for it to connect to external service providers. Today we see that all these information are stored in the application&rsquo;s configuration file, which poses a huge security risk. Anyone having access to this configuration file could use this information to access sensitive data posing a security risk. Having understood this risk, we would not want to keep these secrets anymore in the application but move it to a safer and secure place. With <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Azure Key Vault</a>, we can have this information encrypted and saved safely out of the application and use as required from the application.Azure Key Vault provides a feature of saving such small data, <strong>Secrets</strong>, into the vault and access them over a secure endpoint.</p>

<blockquote><p>Secrets in Azure Key Vault are octet sequences with a maximum size of 10k bytes each and can have any data stored.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are new to Azure Key Vault and yet to setup a vault, you could refer to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Getting Started with Azure Key Vault</a>, to setup the vault and the Active Directory(AD) application that is used to authenticate our application to access the keyvault. Since in this case we are going to use Secrets from the key vault, while setting the key vault access policy for the the AD application, we need to explicitly set access for the application to use the secrets. Access Policy to secrets and keys are distinct and can be set accordingly and you can choose to have different application&rsquo;s to access keys and secrets separately. In the below script I have set the same application to have access to keys and secrets, by setting  <em>PermissionsToKeys</em> and <em>PermissionsToSecrets</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="nb">Set-AzureKeyVaultAccessPolicy</span> <span class="n">-VaultName</span> <span class="s1">&#39;TestVaultRahul&#39;</span> <span class="n">-ServicePrincipalName</span> <span class="s1">&#39;d4f09821-ab30-44f3-8d57-69925489b932&#39;</span> <span class="n">-PermissionsToKeys</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="n">-PermissionsToSecrets</span> <span class="n">all</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To create a secret in the Vault, you can use the powershell script command as shown below. On successful creation of the secret the identifier to the secret is returned, which can be used by the application to obtain the Secret value.Since we have given the AD application &lsquo;<em>all</em>&rsquo; access, we could also create the secret using the api client.</p>

<p>For the application to access this secret all it needs is the SecretIdentifier and the AD credentials to authenticate with the key vault. You would want to use <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">certificate based authentication</a> to authenticate against the AD application so that only the thumbprint information needs to be there in the application&rsquo;s configuration and not the secret itself as that is again a sensitive information.</p>

<p>No longer do we need to keep these sensitive information in the applications configuration file, we can just have the Secret Identifiers configured in the application and have the application fetch is as required from the vault. By doing this we have kept the sensitive information out of reach from the application and also from the people who have access to a production environment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><blockquote><p>Please check <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">here</a> for scripts using the latest PowerShell cmdlets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Azure Key Vault provides an easy way for managing cryptographic keys and secrets (like connection strings or passwords) in a secure and distributed manner as opposed to having them in the configuration file or a database. If you are new to Azure Key Vault check out the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Getting Started with Azure Key Vault</a> on how to setup the vault and add keys and use that from a console application.</p>

<p>In this post we will explore into the ways of authenticating a client application with a key vault. For an application to use the key vault it must authenticate using a token from the Azure Active Directory (AD). For this an application needs to be registered in the Azure AD and this application needs to be authorized to access key or secret in the vault using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn903607.aspx">Set-AzureKeyVaultAccessPolicy</a> that comes as part of the <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Azure-Key-Vault-Powershell-1349b091">key vault powershell scripts</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>As of today, the keyvault will be created in the Default AD associated to the azure subscription and there is no way that it can be created in a different directory. But maybe this will be <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/21d0dcaa-791c-4f96-8f9d-738b6b0076b2/create-a-new-key-vault-in-a-different-directory?forum=AzureKeyVault">supported in future</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>So for a client to access the key vault, it needs to obtain the token from the Azure AD application, which can be done using 2 ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using ClientId and secret</li>
<li>Using ClientId and certificate</li>
</ul>


<h4><strong>Using ClientId and Secret</strong></h4>

<p>Creating an application that can be authenticated using clientid and secret can be done using the management portal. In the azure management portal, we need to create to the application under the default AD. To find the default AD you can check under the settings in the portal</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Default Active Directory under Settings" src="/images/default_ad_settings.PNG" /></p>

<p>To add an application in the default, under Active Directory select the default AD and the applications tab and select &lsquo;<em>Add an application</em>&rsquo;.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Create an Application under default" src="/images/default_ad.PNG" /></p>

<p>From the pop-up select &lsquo;<em>Add an application my organization is developing</em>&rsquo; and give a name of your choice and of type &lsquo;<em>Web Application AND/OR WEB API</em>&rsquo;. In the App properties window it asks for the &lsquo;<em>Sign-On Url</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>App ID Uri</em>&rsquo;, for which you can give two unique values and is not mandatory that it should exists. On confirming these values the AD application would be created and you would be presented with the application properties. Under the &lsquo;<em>Configure</em>&rsquo; tab, you can see the Client ID and below that there is an option to create the &lsquo;<em>keys</em>&rsquo; which will be the secret.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="AD Application Configure" src="/images/ad_application_configure.PNG" /></p>

<p>In the drop-down under the keys select the duration and choose a duration of your choice and save. On saving the secret will be generated. Copy this secret and keep for reference to use in the client application.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="AD Application Secret Generation" src="/images/ad_application_keys.PNG" /></p>

<p>Now that we have created the application and have the clientid and the secret we need to authorize the application to access the key vault. For this we use the <em>Set-AzureKeyVaultAccessPolicy</em> from the powershell and provide the client id of the application that we have just created. The <em>PermissionToKeys</em> parameter determines the permission that the application would have on the keys in the vault which can take multiple comma separated values (all, backup, create, decrypt, delete, encrypt, import, get, list, restore, sign, wrapkey, unwrapkey, update and verify). Similarly for access to secrets in the keyvault you need to set <em>PermissionToSecrets</em> which can all take multiple values (all, delete, get, list and set).</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now using the clientid and the secret we can authenticate from the client application using it as below</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4><strong>Using ClientId and Certificate</strong></h4>

<p>Creating an application that can be authenticated using the clientid and the certificate is only possible using powershell scripts, and these are again available with the key vault powershell scripts. For this we first need to create a certificate or if your organization already has provided one use that. Since this is for demo I would be creating a test certificate as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/ff699202.aspx">explained here</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once we have the certificate, we can create a new AD application and specify certificate authentication for the application as shown below. Make sure that you give the full path to the certificate as below (mine was located under C:\cert)</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once the application is created, we need to perform the same authorization steps as above to give the application access to the key vault, after which we can use the clientid (that would be output to the powershell console) and the certificate to authenticate the application. Make sure that the certificate is installed into the store so that it can be used by the application.</p>

<p>You could use either ways to authenticate an application to Azure Key Vault. Using the certificate way would be more secure as you can also password protect your certificate so that it cannot be installed without having that. If using the client secret anybody having access to the configuration would be able to access the vault. Also make sure that you give the application&rsquo;s only necessary permissions for accessing keys and secrets while registering the application. You could use the sample used in the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Getting Started with Azure Key Vault</a> <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/AzureKeyVault">sample</a>. The code in there uses clientId and secret, you could change it with the above code to use certificate authentication.</p>

<p>Azure Key Vault service is a cloud hosted, HSM(Hardware Security Modules)-backed service for managing cryptographic keys and other secrets. With Azure Key Vault, the process of managing and controlling the keys required for an application or multiple applications for an enterprise can be handled at a centralized place. Also these sensitive information no longer needs to be exposed in the application&rsquo;s configuration file or in database. Keys can be created in the vault and accessed via url&rsquo;s by the required application. Operations against the Key Vault are authenticated and authorized using Azure Active Directory. So in short all that a developer would need to know are the URI&rsquo;s for the keys, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn903625.aspx">sdk/api</a> to access the vault features and also on the mechanism to authenticate against the AD application (an appId/client secret or appId/certificate).</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Azure Key Vault Overview" src="/images/azurekeyvault_overview.png" /></p>

<h3>Key Types</h3>

<p>The initial release of Azure Key Vault only supports RSA keys (asymmetric cryptography) - it supports both software and HSM processed keys, and are represented as JSON Web Key objects. In future there might be more support for the different key types that are there in cryptography. For those who are new to cryptography or needs a quick recap on cryptography algorithms:</p>

<h5><strong>Symmetric Cryptography</strong></h5>

<p>Symmetric cryptography, uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. The keys are shared between the identities that require to transfer the encrypted data.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Symmetric Encryption" src="/images/symmetric_encryption.png" /></p>

<h5><strong>Asymmetric Cryptography</strong></h5>

<p>Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography uses two separate keys - a public key and private key. The public key can be used to encrypt the data or to verify a digital signature whereas the private key is used to decrypt the text or to digital sign.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Asymmetric Encryption" src="/images/asymmetric_encryption.png" /></p>

<p>To create a new key in the Azure Key Vault, first we need to create the vault, using powershell scripts. You would need to install <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/azure-key-vault-and-powershell-module-version/">azure module version 0.8.13 version or higher</a> for the key vault scripts to execute. Detailed steps on creating the vault and keys is documented <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/documentation/articles/key-vault-get-started/">here</a>. Once we have the key created we can get the attributes of the key, using <em>Get-AzureKeyVaultKey</em>. This is as per the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-41#page-25">JSON Web Key(JWK) format</a>. The &lsquo;<em>n/e</em>&rsquo; values in the below key are for the RSA key type(<em>kty</em>), showing the public key information.</p>

<h3>Key Operations</h3>

<p>Now that we have a key in the vault, we can use this to perform different operations allowed on the key, as provided in the <em>key_ops</em> field in the key details above. Typical operations that can be performed using the key are Encrypt, Decrypt, Sign, Verify, WrapKey and UnWrapKey. For an application to use the key vault keys, it needs to authenticate using a token from the Azure Active Directory. For this we first need to <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/key-vault-get-started/#register">register an application with azure active directory</a> and then use the Application id and Authentication key(client secret) to authenticate against the AD application. Instead of using the  key/secret, this could also be through a certificate authentication, which might be a more preferred approach(For the simplicity of this demo will use the application id and the secret directly). To connect to the AD application we can use the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory/2.14.201151115">Active Directory Authentication Library</a> nuget package, the KeyVault libraries are availalble as part of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45343">samples</a>.</p>

<p>The application first uses the AD application credentials to authenticate and obtain the token for further interacting with the key vault. Using the key identifier that is available we get the details of the key.For performing the get operation the &lsquo;<em>PermissionToKeys</em>&rsquo;, should be set appropriately when registering the AD application, using Set-AzureKeyVaultAccessPolicy, against the key vault. Since this is RSA asymmetric algorithm, we have the public key available to us, and we can use this to encrypt the data or to verify the signature, locally in the application itself, though the vault client provides this for convenience.</p>

<p>As above, we use the public key available to create the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider(v=vs.110).aspx">RSACryptoServiceProvider</a> to encrypt the data and also to verify the signature locally. So in an application we can encrypt the data locally and use the vault to decrypt it when required. Decryption can happen only from the vault, as the private key is only available in the vault, and does not cross the vault boundary.</p>

<p>With Azure Key Vault, managing keys and restricting application permission for keys can be easily managed and no information needs to be passed on to the developer or to any specific individual. Also the keys are secure behind the vault service and can also be protected using a HSM. You would need to update the application id and secret in the <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/AzureKeyVault">sample</a> for it to work. Hope this helps in getting you started with Azure Key Vault.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I was trying out the public preview of the  Azure Key Vault service that has been released recently. While following the steps as mentioned in their <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/kv/archive/2015/01/08/azure-key-vault-making-the-cloud-safer.aspx">blog</a>, came across the below error when trying the &lsquo;<em>New-AzureKeyVault</em>&rsquo; command.</p>

<blockquote><p>Please install Azure Powershell module version 0.8.13 or newer.</p></blockquote>

<p>I did have the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/install-configure-powershell/#Install">latest powershell for azure</a> installed, but still this error is thrown.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="azure powershell installed version" src="/images/azure_powershell_installed.png" /></p>

<p>Exploring the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn868052.aspx">powershell scripts for key vault</a>, below is where the error is thrown from &lsquo;<em>Common.ps1</em>&rsquo;. The script looks for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn654592.aspx">AzureResourceManager</a>, which got introduced in poweshell version 0.8.0 and lets you manage resources in a completely different way.</p>

<blockquote><p>When you use the Azure PowerShell cmdlets, the Azure module is imported into the session by default. To remove the Azure module from the session and import the AzureResourceManager and AzureProfile modules, use the Switch-AzureMode cmdlet.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is what is exactly causing the issue, we need to switch to use the azure resource manager. Running the below command and trying the &lsquo;<em>New-AzureKeyVault</em>&rsquo; command works like a charm</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><em>This post just describes a bug that is there in the Unity (3.5.1404) IoC container, when using the IsRegistered extension method, to check for generic types and a possible fix for it.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff647202.aspx">Unity</a> IoC container provides <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.practices.unity.unitycontainerextensions.isregistered(v=pandp.51).aspx">IsRegistered</a> extension method, that can be used to check whether a registration exists for a given type and name (can be null too) combination. When a generic type is registered in the container and trying to check IsRegistered using a concrete typed version of the generic interface it returns false.</p>

<p>As shown in the below code snippet, calling IsRegistered on a non-generic interface(<em>IFooBar</em>) returns true, indicating that a registration exists. But for the generic interface(<em>IFooGeneric&lt;></em>), trying to check if a registration exists for a concrete type (<em>IFooGeneric<string></em> - as only concrete types can be resolved from the container and an open generic type cannot be resolved) it returns false.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://unity.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#source/Unity/Src/UnityContainerExtensions.cs">IsRegistered method </a> as shown below, loops through the list of available registrations looking for a match on the registered type and name. The &lsquo;<em>typeToCheck</em>&rsquo; is the type of the object that we are trying to resolve in IsRegistered - <em>typeof(IFooGeneric<string>)</em>, but the registered type is <em>typeof(IFooGeneric&lt;>)</em>. Because of this the comparison fails and the registration does not pass the where clause of the query, causing the function to return <em>false</em>.</p>

<p>A similar <a href="https://unity.codeplex.com/discussions/568979">issue</a> was already raised in the unity discussions, which I feel was closed inappropriately.</p>

<blockquote><p>If a container can Resolve a particular type then it should also be able to return that it IsRegistered.</p></blockquote>

<p>Please do be aware that using IsRegistered extensively has a <a href="http://unity.codeplex.com/discussions/268223">negative impact on performance</a> as looping through the Registration looking for the name and type has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O(n) complexity</a>. But that still does not justify the bug!.</p>

<p><em>I have submitted a <a href="https://unity.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/rahulpnath/isRegisteredForGenericTypes/contribution/7903">pull request</a> for the fix and it would be worth checking the latest comments on that to see if there are any better approaches or problems that I might have missed out with my fix!</em>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Often there are times when we need to test multiple implementations of the same interface. We would want to use the same test case against all the implementations so that we <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">don&rsquo;t repeat ourselves</a>. In this post we will see how we can reuse the same test cases to test both the implementation, by running them against both the implementations.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you are just interested in the approach - The same test project dll is run twice using vstest.console, by setting an environment variable. Inside the test, (either in the assembly initialize or test initialize) register the appropriate implementations into a IoC container, based on the environment variable value.</p></blockquote>

<p>Interested in the full implementation, then read on!</p>

<p>Since we are not much bothered about the actual interface and its implementation, I have a very simple interface as below, which calculates the length of the given string.There are two implementations for this that might have two different ways of calculating the length of the string given an input.</p>

<p>Though the sample has a simple interface, this might not be the case in a real life project. So the sample mimics a real time implementation structure - we have one interface project and two other projects that have the corresponding implementation. The implementations could also be in the same assembly and this would be applicable for those scenarios too, and can be made to work with some few tweaks in one of the steps (which I will mention when we are there). The test case project that will have the appropriate test cases.</p>

<p>The test case uses the IoC container to get the corresponding implementation of the interface, so it is not all about switching the registered implementation in the container. If this is only for the tests in this particular class then we could do this in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.testtools.unittesting.testinitializeattribute.aspx">TestInitialize</a> method. But most likely you would have multiple tests and also multiple interfaces that we are using. So we can do this in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.testtools.unittesting.assemblyinitializeattribute.aspx">AssemblyInitialze</a> for the assembly.</p>

<p>The above implementation might work in cases where the number of interfaces are less and also in cases where we have fewer possibilities of implementations, but as soon as the number goes up we will again have to keep repeating  the registrations and the if/else code. This is an IoC registration issue and is best handled using <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/ioc-registration-by-convention/">IoC Registration by Convention</a>. We can have a configuration file matching the environment variable and have the assemblies that are to be loaded mentioned in that and pass only those assemblies to be explicitly registered into the convention registration logic. Even in cases where you have the implementations in the same assembly you can write your convention registration logics accordingly and decide what to register.</p>

<p>We can now run these test dll&rsquo;s using batch files by setting different environment variables as below. The bat files can be integrated into your build</p>

<p>Hope this helps some one trying to reuse test cases for multiple implementations of the same interface. One another way to solve this issue would be to create multiple csproj files and have the same test case classes referred to both the project files, but have the reference assemblies specific to implementations. So in this case we would have multiple test dll&rsquo;s created, which can be run individually. The advantage of going via this approach is that we could have test cases specific to implementations too and also reuse test cases that are same across implementations by referring them as linked files. But currently we did not want this flexibility and did not want to add multiple project files and make it difficult for the team. You can find the sample implementation <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/TestingMultipleImplementations">here</a>. Do you reuse test cases like this? Do drop in with a comment on your thoughts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Sometime back we had seen, how to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/configuring-unity-container-comparing-code-and-xml-configuration-side-by-side/">configure the unity container using code/config file</a> and I was using a mix of this in one of my projects. This approach soon became an overhead, as the manual wiring up of registrations is really cumbersome and also error prone. Mostly there were missing registrations only to be found out, when doing test runs or deployments. We soon were forced to move out of the manual registration and find a new way to register dependencies.</p>

<p>The below image by <a href="https://twitter.com/ploeh">Mark Seemann</a> sums it all up on when and how to use a Dependency Injection(DI) container and we were right at the bottom, where the whole purpose of a DI becomes pointless.</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1zLiq6p" class="center" title="Image By Mark Seemann, from http://bit.ly/1zLiq6p"><img src="/images/ioc_usefulness.png" class="center" alt="Image By Mark Seemann, from http://bit.ly/1zLiq6p"></a></p>

<h4>Convention Over Configuration</h4>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">Convention over configuration</a>, is very popular today and there are already many frameworks that have adopted it e.g. MVC, Web Api. Following the same approach would make life much simpler and registration less painful as dependencies would get auto registered, if the convention is followed. Conventions could vary across projects/teams, so it is up to the team to decide on the conventions that are to be followed and have all the developers follow them religiously.</p>

<p>Currently our registration process picks up all the assemblies from the base path and iterates through all the classes that are under the project/application namespace and gets the interfaces out of them and registers them. For interfaces that have multiple definitions we perform named registration based on the class name or name from an attribute on the class or both.</p>

<p>We are using Unity as the IoC container and it does support <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn507479(v=pandp.30).aspx">convention based registrations</a> out of the box. You can either use the RegisterTypes method or the RegistrationConvention class to specify the conventions. The parameters in both of these approaches enable you to specify the types to register, the mappings to create, the name to use and lifetime. Since in our registration we wanted to use the named convention only in cases where there where multiple registrations for the same interface and the other interfaces were to be registered without any name this default convention had to be modified. Also we did not want to get tightly bound to the IoC container (just in case we want to swap out the container provider) and hence thought of having the convention logics in a separate class and have them registered to the container of choice.</p>

<p>The <em>GetClassesFromAssemblies</em> function iterates over the assemblies from the base application path(bin folder) to get all the dll&rsquo;s used and gets the classes that belong to the namespaces that we want to register. Alternatively you could also pass a list of assemblies if required to be used for the convention. If you want other namespaces too you can filter those in here.</p>

<p>For each of the type that is returned from the above method we get the list of interfaces that are defined on the type and needs to be registered against the type. In the sample code, I have added a couple of variations of registrations.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>IFooBar</em>        : Has only one implementation</li>
<li><em>IFoo</em>           : Has multiple implementations and should be resolved using <em>IFooFactory</em></li>
<li><em>IFooCustom</em>     : Has multiple implementations and needs to have a custom name (maybe for some reason you do not want the context information to be part of the class name). This is to be resolved using IFooCustomFactory.</li>
<li><em>IFooGeneric<T></em> : This is a generic implementation and the type can be decided at runtime.</li>
</ul>


<p>The <em>GetInterfacesToBeRegistered</em> function gets the interfaces that are to be registered for a given type. For this convention I want to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5318685/get-only-direct-interface-instead-of-all">get only the direct interfaces</a> that are on the given type and not all the interfaces. The check below for <em>isGenericType</em> on an interface is for <em>IFooGeneric</em> as for generic interfaces the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3117090/getinterfaces-returns-generic-interface-type-with-fullname-null">GetInterfaces does not return the full information required</a> and we need to use the <em>GetGenericTypeDefinition</em> method instead.</p>

<p>Once we have the interfaces for the type, we add them to an internal mapping list to register it all into the unity container. The internal mapping is against the interface type definition and has the list of classes that implements the interface.Now that we have all the types and interfaces to be registered, we need to register them into the container. For any interface that has only one type implementing it, we register it with default name else we get the name from the class name or the attribute that decorates the class if any.</p>

<p>The dependency with UnityContainer with the IoCConveniton class, can be easily removed by having an adapter interface into any container. To keep things simple I am having the direct dependency on the container in the sample. From the console application we can create a new container and use the convention class to register the dependencies. The factory implementations have the expected class conventions inside them that would be used to resolve the dependencies. Since the factory is part of the composition root I am using a <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/03/15/ImplementinganAbstractFactory/">container based factory</a>, to resolve the dependencies.</p>

<p>This has really taken off a lot of work for all the developers in the team and registrations of dependencies works seamlessly. You can find the sample convention implementation <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/IocConventionRegistration">here</a>. Are you using convention registrations in your applications? If not you should start using them.

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Reading is inevitable to keep up to date with the latest technologies and rapid changes happening in the programming world. But technology is nothing but a tool for getting things done. What one has to understand are the concepts and principles underlying these technology and the core principles of development. These are to be gained through <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/an-enterprise-it-project-experience/">our own experiences</a> and also from the learnings and the experiences of others. Books are a great source of such experiences, and this post is a list of those that I have found interesting and helpful. I have not read all these nor was I able to fully understand whatever I have. These books are to be read/referred to multiple times, practiced and adopted into our work. It&rsquo;s also worth referring other books from the same author&rsquo;s or other writings as they are among the pioneers in our industry.</p>

<p>The books would speak for themselves and I don&rsquo;t think I can do justice writing a summary to any of these. So I have decided to just list them down here(in no specific order). It&rsquo;s worth having a personal copy of each one of these in your bookshelves. (mine is still short of some of them).</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><blockquote><p>A Repository abstracts the persistence logic from the core business logic and allows the data to be accessed as it would have been from an in-memory object collection.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">Repository Pattern</a> is useful when you want your domain objects(or entities) to be persistence ignorant but yet have the flexibility to map your data to the choice of your data store e.g. Sql Server, Oracle, NoSQL databases, cache etc. The physical model of the stored data might vary from store to store but not the logical model. So a repository plays the role of mapping a logical model to physical model and vice versa. ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tools like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/data/ef.aspx">Entity Framework</a> does help us to achieve this and we could make use of it wherever possible in building your domain specific repositories.</p>

<p>With large scale applications it is very common to have an external cache, to optimize repeated access to the data held in a data store. The repository is the ideal place to decide on populating, fetching and invalidating the cache. When building the repositories, we would not want to tightly couple ourselves with a specific cache provider or a data store provider like sql nor with any ORM tool like Entity Framework.</p>

<blockquote><p>In this blog post we will be seeing how to keep our Repositories clean and separate from the actual providers and provide a persistence ignorant data access to your business layer.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Creating the Repository</h3>

<p>At the bare minimum a repository should be able to provide CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) options, for which we will have a generic interface defined and have implementation of which will be inherited from, for specific repositories.</p>

<p>The implementation of this interface would need to perform following functionality:</p>

<ol>
<li>Decide on whether to get the data from cache or data store and keep the data consistent.</li>
<li>Get/Modify the data from the cache</li>
<li>Get/Modify the data from the data store.</li>
</ol>


<p>Thinking of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)</a>, it is best to keep these responsibilities separate so that each of them can change independently without changing the other. For this we need to further introduce 2 more interfaces, one for getting the data from the cache and one for the data store. These 2 need not be the same, as a cache would mostly work on a key value pair combination and the one for the data store would need to have the same methods as supported by the repository (You could have them as the same too in case required). As for the repository, it depends on these 2 interface implementation (which we call strategies), to get the data - CacheStrategy or DataStoreStrategy.</p>

<p>We see that above, for the Cache Strategy interface I have added a set of methods that acts on the key and the value, the entity itself. For the DataStore strategy, we have the same methods coming from the IRepository interface so that we can translate them all into corresponding querying format of their storage and return the data.</p>

<p>The Sql data store strategy implementation using Entity Framework would be like below, which will have a context provided to it, that it can use for performing the queries on sql database. Will see more on the context later below.(The interface implementations are omitted below to keep it simple). A cache strategy would also look something similar and would depend on the caching provider that you use.</p>

<h3>Creating Specific Repositories</h3>

<p>There might be cases where we want to query on specific fields or combination of fields or do something that is specific for that repository. In these cases you can extend on to the repository methods. You would need to add a couple of classes for the new specific repository.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new repository interface and implement it.</li>
<li>Create a new data store strategy interface which implements from the new repository interface and the base data store strategy interface and implement it.</li>
<li>In case cache strategy needs an update update its interfaces too as like step 2</li>
</ol>

<h3>Supporting Unit Of Work</h3>

<p>There might be cases where we need to update against multiple repositories and have them all saved in one single transaction. <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html">UnitOfWork</a> (UOW), is the common pattern that is used for this scenario, by passing around a context object that knows how to commit/save after a set of activities. For this support we have added the below set of interfaces.(Currently in this sample only the data store is supporting the transactions)</p>

<p>The DataStoreContext is what maintains the in memory representation of the changes that we make across the repositories and finally saves it to the data store on <em>SaveChangesAsync</em>. For Sql data store we make use of the DbContext provided by Entity Framework, which already implements the same method from our interface. If you see the above sql strategy code, this is the data context that we use to perform queries and updates.</p>

<p>For a client to perform operation, it can get the repositories through the unit of work as shown below.</p>

<h3>IQueryable on your Repositories</h3>

<p>In the repository methods we return an IEnumerable and not an IQueryable, as we want all my querying logics to be contained inside the strategies that implement the real querying. We definitely do not want the querying logic to be there all across the client code accessing the repository, as that would make maintaining the code difficult. Also each of the strategies would have their own ways of querying and should be well abstracted by them. Otherwise all we end up having would be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">leaky abstraction</a></p>

<p>By separating out the cache and data store strategies we have made it possible to change the providers for either of them without affecting any of the repository code. We could switch out the sql data store strategy and have a oracle strategy or a mongodb strategy and have that implement the specifics on how to retrieve the the data that we want. We would also have a specific IDataStoreContext implementation for the corresponding new data store.</p>

<p>You can find the code structure for this <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/RepositoryPattern">here</a>. It only provides the interfaces and some mock implementations and does not connect to any data stores or cache providers. Hope this helps in architecting the repository pattern when dealing with multiple strategies to save. What are your thoughts on this?
