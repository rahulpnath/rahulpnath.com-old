  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>How often have you gone into a class to see the implementation when consuming the class or an interface? I do this almost every other day and it&rsquo;s mostly to check how the code handles boundary conditions. What does it do when there is no value to return, does it need all parameters etc. Reading code is hard and time-consuming, even if it&rsquo;s a code that you yourself have written a few minutes back. Imagine every developer having to go into the implementation detail anytime they consume a class?    Bertrand Meyer in connection with his design of the Eiffel programming language coined the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">Design By Contract</a>, an approach for designing software. The central idea of Design By Contract is to improve the contracts shared between different components in the code base. In this post, we will see how we can improve our C# code and avoid unnecessary guard statements across out code base.</p>

<p><a href="http://nebula.wsimg.com/6e7b8057c7f32b90d4f144424c8a7ae1?AccessKeyId=00F174C5B1CCF865161D&disposition=0&alloworigin=1">

</a></p>

<h3>Leaky Abstraction</h3>

<p>These days in programming we tend to abstract a lot more than what we really need. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/dependency-injection/">Dependency Injection</a> and use of IOC containers have started forcing ourselves to think that everything needs to be an interface. But essentially this is not the case. But the bigger problem lies not in the abstraction, but on depending on the implementation details after abstracting. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">leaky abstraction</a> is an abstraction that exposes details and limitations of its underlying implementation to its users that should ideally be hidden away.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Consuming abstractions assuming a certain implementation is bad practice</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Recently I came across the below code during a code review. Even though an empty string was not a valid configuration value that was not being checked here as the repository implementation returns a null when there is no entry.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="kt">string</span> <span class="n">config</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">repository</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">GetConfig</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">config</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="k">null</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is a common practice and I have myself fallen for this a lot of times. The fact that the repository returns only a null value is an abstraction detail and is not clear from the contract that it exposes. Anyone could change the repository to start returning an empty string. This will then start failing this code. When taken in isolation the code that uses &lsquo;config&rsquo; must check for null and empty to avoid invalid values. The abstraction contracts (function signatures) must convey whether it always returns a value, whether it can be empty or null. This helps remove unnecessary guarding code or makes guarding mandatory across the code base and also indicates a clear intent.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Robustness Principle</a> is a general design guideline for software</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others (often reworded as &ldquo;Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept&rdquo;).</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Applying this principle in this context, we must be conservative in what we return from our function (be it a class or interface) contract. The contract should be as explicit as possible to indicate the nature of values that it returns.</p>

<h3>Stronger Return Types</h3>

<p>A repository returning a string is a weak contract, as it does not clearly express the nature of value it returns. It can return either of these three values - null, an empty string or a valid configuration string. In our application, assuming that null and empty string are invalid we should be having a single representation for this state in the application. C# by its very design encourages us to use this pattern as it embraces the concept of null&rsquo;s - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141126171912-7082046-tony-hoare-invention-of-the-null-reference-a-billion-dollar-mistake">the billion dollar mistake</a>. But this does not mean we are restricted by it. We can bring in concepts from other languages to help us solve this problem. In F# for example, the Option type represents presence or absence of a value. This is similar to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1t3y8s4s.aspx">Nullable type in C#</a>, but not just restricted to value types. <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/the-option-type/">Option type</a> is defined as union type with two cases : Some and None. Whenever consuming an option type the compiler forces us to handle both the cases</p>

<blockquote><p><em>In pure F#, <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/correctness-exhaustive-pattern-matching/">nulls cannot exist accidentally</a>. A string or object must always be assigned to something at creation, and is immutable thereafter</em></p></blockquote>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='fsharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getConfig</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">config</span> <span class="k">with</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">None</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">printfn</span> <span class="s">&quot;Invalid config&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">Some</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">printgn</span> <span class="s">&quot;Valid config&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Though C# does not have anything out of the box to define optional values, we can define one of our own. The <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/Booking/blob/master/BookingDomainModel/Maybe.cs">Maybe</a> class is one such implementation of an optional concept. The name is influenced by the option type in Haskell, <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Maybe">Maybe</a>. There are also other implementations of Maybe but the concept remains the same - we can represent an optional type in C#.  The code contracts are stronger using Maybe as a return type. If a function always returns a value, say a string, the function contract should remain as a string. If a function cannot return a value always and can return null/empty (assuming that these are invalid values) then it returns a <em>Maybe<string></em>. This makes it clearer for consuming code on whether they should check for null/empty values.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="n">Maybe</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">config</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">repository</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">GetConfig</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Do</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">value</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">LoadFromFile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">value</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can write different extension methods on the Maybe class, depending on how you want to process the value. In the above example, I have a Do extension method that calls on to a function with the configuration value if any exists. By explicitly stating that a value may or may not be present we have more clarity in code. No longer do we need any unnecessary null checks in the case where a value is always present. This is best achieved when agreed upon as a convention by the development team and enforced through tooling (like code analysis).</p>

<h3>Value Objects</h3>

<p>One of the root problem for having a lot of null/empty checks scattered across the code is <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/01/19/from-primitive-obsession-to-domain-modelling/">Primitive Obsession</a>. Just because you can represent a value as a string, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you always should. Enforcing structural restrictions imposed by the business is best done by encapsulating these constraints within a class, also known as a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/thinking-beyond-primitive-values-value-objects/">Value Object</a>. This leads to classes for representing various non-nullable values for e.g. Name, configuration, Age etc. You can use this in conjunction with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern">Null Object</a> pattern if required. A value object is a class whose equality is based on the value that it holds. So two class instances with same values will be treated equally. In F# you get this by default but in C# you need to override Equals and GetHashCode functions to enforce this equality.</p>

<p>Modeling concepts in the domain as classes helps you to contain the domain/business constraints in a single place. This prevents the need to have null checks elsewhere in the code. Value objects being immutable helps enforce class invariants.</p>

<p>The above two methods help create a stronger contract in code. As with any conventions, this is useful only when followed by the whole team. Conventions are best followed if enforced through tooling. You can create custom code analysis rules to enforce return type to be of type if any method is returning null. Even if you are introducing this into a large existing code base you can do this incrementally, by starting to enforce them on commits (if you are using git) like when <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/introducing-code-formatting-into-a-large-codebase/">introducing styling into an existing project</a>. What other contracts do you find helpful to make the code more expressive?</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><a href="http://www.dhc-gmbh.com/en/kompetenzen/business-process-management/"><img class="center" alt="Business" src="/images/business_problem_automation.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>While working with clients I often get into conversations with the domain experts and people involved directly with the business. The discussions usually happen around what the process they are currently doing and how to automate those. Knowing the business process is helpful but getting influenced by that to design the solution is often not effective. Recently our team was in a conversation with a domain expert for a new feature request.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
The series of events mentioned below were modified to fit into the conversational style used in the post.
</div>


<blockquote><p><em><strong>Domain Expert</strong> We need to charge customers a processing fee if they pay using an electronic payment method. Depending on the type of card (mastercard, visa etc) the processing charge percentage differs. The processing fees are always charged in the subsequent billing period after their current payment. For e.g. if a customer pays 1000$ for the month of November, then his December bill will have 2% card processing charge in the December invoice</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Team</strong> That sounds easy, think we have enough details to get started on this. Thank you.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Domain Expert</strong> Perfect. Ahhh&hellip; Before you go, I think this can be a <a href="http://hangfire.io/">hangfire job</a> that runs on 29 every month, a few days before the billing date, 3rd, and generate these charges for the client. This is what we do manually at present. (And walks off)</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Team</strong> Discussing amongst themselves the team agreed that creating a recurring job is the way to go. Based on the assumption that this job will be run only once a month, the job was to read all the invoices from 29th of the previous month till 28th of the current month and charge the clients. The meeting was dismissed and off went everyone busy to get the new feature out</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Business has Exceptions</h3>

<p>Problems started coming up the immediate month of feature deployment. Below is the sequence of events that happened.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>29th</strong> : Nice work, team! The processing charges have been applied as expected.</li>
<li><strong>30th</strong> : Some of the invoices have wrong data. We have deleted them. Can you run the job?</li>
<li><strong>2nd</strong> : A few of our clients (as usual) paid late and we need to charge their processing fees. Can you run the job?</li>
<li><strong>15th</strong> : One of our clients is ending tomorrow, so we need to send them an invoice and it should include the processing fees for their last payment. Can you run the job?</li>
</ul>


<p>But wait! We had decided that we will run this job only once a month and that is the only time we need to process the charges. We cannot run that job over and over again.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>What I’ve noticed over the years is that our users find very creative ways to achieve their business objectives despite the limitations of the system that they’re working with. We developers ultimately see these as requirements, but they are better interpreted as <strong>workarounds</strong>.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>- <a href="http://udidahan.com/2013/04/28/queries-patterns-and-search-food-for-thought/">Udi Dahan</a></em></strong></p></blockquote>

<p>The business was right when it said that <em>&lsquo;This is what we do manually at present.</em> What they did not say though is that there were always exceptions. And in these cases, they did the same process, but just for those exceptions. Business process mostly will be around the majority of the cases and the exceptions always get handled ad-hoc. So for the business it&rsquo;s always that which takes a good part of their time that matters more.</p>

<h3>Finding the Way Out</h3>

<p>The problem, in this case, was that the team modeled the solution exactly as the business did manually. Think kind of a solution is most likely to fail in case of exceptions. The human brain can easily deal with these exceptions. But for a program to solve it that way it needs to be told so, which implies that there need to be alternate flow paths defined. So with the improved understanding of these exception cases, the team does another analysis through the problem. After some discussion the team re-defines their original problem statement - *We need to be able to run the job any number of times and it should have the same effect.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>A payment should get </em>one and only one<em> processing charge associated, no matter however times it is seen by the job.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>With the new implementation, we decided to maintain a list of payments (a strong identifier that does not change) we have seen and processed. So every time a payment is seen, it is matched to see if it is already processed. If a charge is not already applied, a charge is applied and added to the list of processed payments. This ensures that they can run the job anytime. The team added in capability to specify the time range to look for invoices. By default, this ranged from 29th - 28th. The team also added in a way to void out payment charges applied, so that whenever the invoices changed then can just clear that off and re-run the job. These changes gave the flexibility to meet the businesses exception cases.</p>

<h3>Idempotent</h3>

<blockquote><p><em>The term <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/IdempotentReceiver.html">idempotent</a> is used in mathematics to describe a function that produces the same result if it is applied to itself, i.e. f(x) = f(f(x)). In Messaging this concept translates into a message that has the same effect whether it is received once or multiple times. This means that a message can safely be re-sent without causing any problems even if the receiver receives duplicates of the same message.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Being idempotent is what we missed with the first implementation. There was an assumed &lsquo;idempotency&rsquo; that the job will be run only once a month. But this constraint is not something that the code had control of and something it could enforce. The job was also not idempotent at the granular level that it was affecting - payments. Asserting idempotency at the batch level fails when we want to re-run batches (when exceptions like the wrong invoice happens). Idempotency should be enforced at the unit level of change, which is what maintaining a list of processed payments helps with. Any payment that is not processed before will get processed now when the job is run. We can also ensure that the payment will only be processed at most once.</p>

<p>This is just an example where we fail to see beyond the business problem and also see the computing problems accompanying it. Not always will it be easy and fast to rewrite the code. Even if we fail to see these problems the business will eventually make us to. But it is when we can see the computing problems that accompanies a business problem that we start becoming better developers. Applying basic computing principles, probing the domain expert during discussions, sitting with domain experts while they work etc. are all good ways to start seeing the untold business processes. Hope this helps the next time you are into a meeting with domain expert or solving a business problem.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I came across this <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/90d4b814-f025-42a0-acac-b8c8bf9d8cf8/alert-or-event-on-secret-expiry?forum=AzureKeyVault">question</a> in Azure Key Vault forums looking for options to get notified when Key or Secrets in vault nears expiry. It&rsquo;s useful to know when Object&rsquo;s (Keys/Secrets) near expiry, to take necessary action. I decided to explore on my proposed solution of having a scheduled custom PowerShell script to notify when a key is about to expire. In this post, we will see how to get all objects nearing expiry and scheduling this using Azure Runbook to run daily.</p>

<h3>Getting Expiring Objects</h3>

<p>Both Keys and Secrets can be set with an Expiry date. The expiry date can be set when creating the Object or can be set on an existing Object. This can be set from the UI or using PowerShell scripts (setting the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn868045.aspx">-Expires attribute</a>).</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Azure Key Vault - Set Key Expiry" src="/images/vaultexpiry_key.png"/></p>

<p>Key Vault (at the time of writing) throws an <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/c0d8953a-c117-4ca4-ad3d-e5d2b1868f9e/get-operation-not-permitted-for-some-of-the-secret-in-my-vault?forum=AzureKeyVault">exception</a> when an expired key is accessed over the API. Also, it does not provide any notification whenever a key/secret is about to expire. The last thing you want is your application go down because of an expired object in the vault. With the Get and List access on the vault, we can retrieve all the keys and secrets in the vault and loop through the elements to see objects that are nearing expiry.</p>

<p>The PowerShell script takes the Vault Name, number of days before with alert should be raised and flags to indicate whether all versions of keys/secrets should be checked for expiry. The full script is available <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/blob/master/KeyVaultExpiryAlerter/Expiry%20Alert.ps1">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Scheduling Expiry Notification using Azure Runbook</h3>

<p>You can either run this manually every time you want to get a list of objects that are expired or nearing expiry. Alternatively, you can set up a scheduled task to run the script at a set frequency. Since you are already on Azure, you can try <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/automation/">Azure Automation</a> and schedule the task for you. A Runbook in Azure Automation account can be granted access to the key vault. The Automation account should have &lsquo;Run as account&rsquo; setup and the service principal created for it can be used to assign Access Policies to access the vault. Check out the <a href="/blog/accessing-azure-key-vault-from-azure-runbook">Accessing Azure Key Vault From Azure Runbook</a> post for a step by step instruction on how to setup runbook to access key vault. You can then <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/automation-scheduling-a-runbook/">schedule the runbook</a> to execute at fixed time intervals. Feel free to modify the script to send email notifications or push notification or any other that matches your need.</p>

<p>Generally, it is a good practice to rotate your keys and secrets once in a while. Use the expiry attribute to set the expiry and force yourself to keep your sensitive configurations fresh. It&rsquo;s likely that such a notification feature will be built into the key vault. But till then Hope this helps to keep track of keys or secrets that are nearing expiry within the vault and take the necessary action to renew them. The full script is available <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/blob/master/KeyVaultExpiryAlerter/Expiry%20Alert.ps1">here</a>.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Azure Automation is a new service in Azure that allows you to automate your Azure management tasks and to orchestrate actions across external systems from right within Azure. If you are new to Azure Automation, get started <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-automation-runbook-management/">here</a>. Runbooks live within the Azure Automation account and can execute PowerShell scripts. In this post, I will walk you through on how to use Key Vault from an Azure Automation Runbook.</p>

<p>To create a Runbook go to &lsquo;Add a Runbook&rsquo; under  Automation Account, Runbooks as shown in the image below. Once created you can author your PowerShell script there.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Azure Automation Create a Runbook" src="/images/runbook_create.png"/></p>

<p>In this example I will get all the Keys from an existing key vault, using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn868053.aspx">Get-AzureKeyVaultKey</a> cmdlet. This returns all the key for the given key vault.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="nb">Get-AzureKeyVaultKey</span> <span class="n">-VaultName</span> <span class="n">YoutubeVault</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If we are to run this script now, it will fail for many reasons - we do not have the key vault cmdlets imported in the runbook nor have we given access to the automation account to access the keys in the vault. Running it gives me the below error.</p>

<p><span style='color:red'><em>Get-AzureKeyVaultKey : The term &lsquo;Get-AzureKeyVaultKey&rsquo; is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function script, file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again </em></span>.</p>

<p>Under &lsquo;Assets&rsquo; from the Azure Automation account Resources section select &lsquo;Modules&rsquo; (as shown in the image below) to add in Modules to the runbook. To execute key vault cmdlets in the runbook, we need to add <em>AzureRM.profile</em> and AzureRM.key vault. Search for this under &lsquo;Browse Gallery&rsquo; and import.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Azure Runbook Add KeyVault Module" src="/images/runbook_add_Module.png"/></p>

<p>To give Runbook access to the keys in the vault, it needs to be specified in the Access Policies of the key vault. The &lsquo;Run As Accounts&rsquo; feature will create a new service principal user in Azure Active Directory and assign the Contributor role to this user at the subscription. The &lsquo;Application ID&rsquo; from creating the run as account is used to assign Access Policies for the key vault. In this example, I give the &lsquo;list&rsquo; and &lsquo;get&rsquo; PermissionToKeys.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Azure Automation Runbook, set run as account" src="/images/runbook_run_as_accounts.png"/></p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/automation-sec-configure-azure-runas-account/#sample-code-to-authenticate-with-resource-manager-resources">sample code below</a>, taken from the AzureAutomationTutorialScript example runbook, to authenticate using the Run As account to manage Resource Manager resources with your runbooks. The <em>AzureRunAsConnection</em> is a connection asset automatically created when we created &lsquo;run as accounts&rsquo; above. This can be found under Assets -> Connections. After the authentication code, I run the same code above to get all the keys from the vault.</p>

<p>On execution, the Runbook can connect to the key vault and retrieve all the keys. Based on the permissions set on the vault you can perform different actions on the key vault. This helps in automating a lot of tasks that otherwise needs to be done manually. Hope this helps you connect Runbooks with Key Vault.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Digital Signature is a mechanism to ensure the validity of a digital document or message. Digital signatures use <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">asymmetric cryptography</a> - uses a public and private key pair.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>A valid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digital signature</a> gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), that the sender cannot deny having sent the message (non-repudiation), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity)</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The below diagram shows the overview of the different steps involved in the Digital Signature process. We generate a hash of the data that we need to protect and encrypt the hash value using a private key pair. This signed hash is sent along with the original data. The receiver generates a hash of the data received and also decrypts the attached signature using the public key. If both the hashes are same, the signature is valid, and the document has not been tampered with.</p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Digital_Signature_diagram.svg"><img class="center" alt="Azure Key Vault - Verify Signature Offline" src="/images/signing_verification.png"/></a></p>

<p>Azure Key Vault supports sign and verify operations and can be used to implement Digital Signatures. In this post, we will explore how to sign and verify a message using Key Vault. Verifying the hash locally is the recommended approach as per the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn903623.aspx#BKMK_KeyOperations">documentation</a> and we will explore how this can be achieved.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Verification of signed hashes is supported as a convenience operation for applications that may not have access to [public] key material; it is recommended that, for best application performance, verify operations are performed locally.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Signing Data</h3>

<p>Sign and Verify operations on Key Vault are allowed only on hashed data. So the application calling these API methods should locally hash the data before invoking the method. The algorithm property value passed to the Key Vault Client API depends on the hashing algorithm used to hash the data. Below are the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/Mt149357.aspx">supported algorithms</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>RS256: RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 using SHA-256. The application supplied digest value must be computed using SHA-256 and must be 32 bytes in length.</em></li>
<li><em>RS384: RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 using SHA-384. The application supplied digest value must be computed using SHA-384 and must be 48 bytes in length.</em></li>
<li><em>RS512: RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 using SHA-512. The application supplied digest value must be computed using SHA-512 and must be 64 bytes in length.</em></li>
<li><em>RSNULL: See [RFC2437], a specialized use-case to enable certain TLS scenarios.</em></li>
</ul>


<p>The below code sample uses SHA-256 hashing algorithm to hash and sign the data.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Verify Online</h3>

<p>To verify a signature online, the keyVaultClient supports a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.azure.keyvault.keyvaultclient.verifyasync.aspx">Verify method</a>. It takes the key identifier, algorithm, digest and signature to verify if the signature is valid for the given digest.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Verify Offline</h3>

<p>To Verify offline, we need access to the public portion of the key used to sign the data. The client application that needs to verify signatures can connect to the vault and get the key details or use a public key shared out of band. The <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">AD application used to authenticate</a> with the key vault should have Get access for retrieving the public key from the vault. Get access can be set using the PermissionToKeys switch when registering the AD application with the key vault. Assuming we have access to the public key as a JSON string, we can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rsacryptoserviceprovider(v=vs.110).aspx">RSACryptoServiceProvider</a> to verify the signature offline.</p>

<p>The signature verification succeeds if the message and the signature were not tampered. If either of message or signature were  modified then the signature validation fails.</p>

<p>You can get the sample code <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/VerifySignatureOffline">here</a>. Hope this helps you to implement Digital Signatures using Key Vault.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>The current state of the IT industry demands one to be constantly on the go and learning something new. New technologies, frameworks, languages etc. are getting released almost every other day. It is easy to get overwhelmed with all this information. The best way to keep up is to ignore most of it. But every now and then you would want to learn something new either because of project demands or out of personal interests. It is important to have a learning plan for yourself and stick through with it when wanting to learn something. If not it&rsquo;s easy to get distracted. These are some of the ways how I try to structure my learning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/media/keeleuniversity/lpdc/images/LPDC-Banner-Blue.jpg">
<img  alt="Make writing a habit - write daily" src="/images/learning_continuosly.png"/>
</a></p>

<h4><strong>Choosing and Sticking to a Topic</strong></h4>

<p>The most important thing in learning something new is to decide on what to learn. This could either be driven by work needs or personal interests. It&rsquo;s easier when driven by work needs as you do not have much to choose on. But still, you need to make sure that you stay within the boundaries of what you are trying to learn. It&rsquo;s easy to get off track as there might be a lot of things that come up which you are not aware of. At times understanding things with a certain level of abstraction is important. Just like social networks distracting you off from real work, different terminologies can get you off on a different path. So make sure you always stick to your end goal.</p>

<h4><strong>Books, Blogs, Videos</strong></h4>

<p>There are different ways that you can learn something new. It could either be books, videos, podcasts, blogs etc. There is no such thing as the best mode to learn. Mode of learning is person specific. So don&rsquo;t try to just imitate what your friend does. Try to find what works for you the best. Whenever I am learning something new, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/language-agnostic-books-for-every-developer-2/">books</a> work the best. Books give a structured approach to a new topic and eases your way through the topic. Though I have a Kindle, for technical books I <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/ebook-or-hard-copy/">prefer hard copies</a>. Often I find the need to refer back or forward a few pages and it feels best on a physical book.  I find blogs useful for learning more about a topic that I already have some idea about. For getting an overview of topics and interesting things I find videos and podcasts useful. So depending upon the need I mix and match these different learning modes.</p>

<p><img alt="Current Reading List" src="/images/learning_books.jpg"/></p>

<h4><strong>Open Source Projects, Forums, Demo application</strong></h4>

<p>It is important that you try out whatever your learn. There are different ways that you can learn by doing and depends on the individual. When learning a new topic I choose to come up with a sample application to be built using the new technology that I am learning. I created <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/picfinity/9wzdncrdwxx8">Picfinity</a> when I was learning Window 8 Modern applications. Once comfortable with a topic I choose to either answer <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/stars-do-count/">questions on forums</a> (mostly <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/rahul%20p%20nath?type=forum&amp;referrer=http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=AzureKeyVault">msdn</a> or <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/2205373/rahul-p-nath">stack overflow</a>). Contributing to open source projects is also another approach to gets some hands-on experience. Contributing to open source projects also helps the community and improves your self-confidence. <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> is a good place to start with open source contribution.</p>

<h4><strong>Freelancing</strong></h4>

<p>Not always you get to implement what you learn at your work. Implementing in real world projects is an important aspect of learning. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-freelancing-jobs-online/">Freelancing</a> is a good way to get work in areas that you want to improve or learn. Bid for projects that uses technologies that you are learning. It might be hard to get offered projects on technologies that you have no prior experience with. Showcasing any sample applications that you have built while learning increases your chances of getting the job. I used Picfinity to show that I can build Windows 8 and phone applications. This landed me opportunities to build different windows phone and windows 8 application.</p>

<h4><strong>Blog</strong></h4>

<p>Sharing your learnings helps improve your own understanding of the topic. It also helps others taking your same path and learning the new topic. Each one of us has a different perspective of understanding and learning things. So don&rsquo;t worry if you are writing about something that is already been written about. Make sure you blog your learnings and if you are new to blogging then there is no better time to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/blogging/">get started</a>. Blogs act as a good resume when applying for a job.</p>

<p>With new technologies and frameworks coming up every other day it is hard to keep up with all of them. It is not necessary to understand everything that is out there. What is important is that you should be able to learn quickly when the need arises. Also keep yourself aware of the changes in the industry and technologies you use. It does not matter if you do not know all the latest technologies. What matters is how fast you can learn a new concept. Have a learning plan! What do you find the most effective way to learn?

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>You can now manage Key Vault through the Azure portal. Prior to this the Key Vault&rsquo;s were managed either using <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">Powershell</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/managing-azure-key-vault-using-azure-resource-manager-arm-templates/">ARM Templates</a> or <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/managing-azure-key-vault-over-the-rest-api/">REST API</a>. Managing key Vault is now easy and user-friendly for the nontechnical people. In this post, I will walk through the new features in Azure Portal to manage key vault.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>If you find any difference between what you see in the portal versus those in the screenshots below, it&rsquo;s likely that the portal is updated</em></p></blockquote>

<p>In the new Azure portal search for &lsquo;key vault&rsquo; to access this new feature. Or you can go to &lsquo;More Services&rsquo; and scroll down to &lsquo;Security + Identity&rsquo; section in the menu. Selecting Key Vault takes you to all the available Key Vaults under your subscription. You can further filter the Vault&rsquo;s list by the vault name using the filter box or based on your subscriptions.</p>

<p><img  alt="Key Vault in Azure Portal" src="/images/keyvaultportal_menu_option.png"/></p>

<h4><strong>Creating Key Vault</strong></h4>

<p>To create a new Key Vault select the &lsquo;Create&rsquo; option. By entering the Vault Name, Subscription, Resource Group and Location you can create a new Key Vault.</p>

<p><img  alt="Create Key Vault in Azure Portal" src="/images/keyvaultportal_create_key_vault.png"/></p>

<p>The pricing tier defaults to Standard and it does not support HSM backed keys. This means you will be only able to create Software keys. You can select the  Premium pricing tier if you need HSM backed keys. By default the login with which you create the subscription with gets granted access to the vault and is added to the access policies. You can grant additional applications or users access and control the permissions. Below I am adding in an AD application.</p>

<p><img  alt="Key Vault Add Access Policy" src="/images/keyvaultportal_access_policy.png"/></p>

<p>You can specify the Key Permissions and the Secret Permissions that the ServicePrincipal.</p>

<p><img  alt="Access Policy set Secret Permissions" src="/images/keyvaultportal_secretpermissions.png"/></p>

<h4><strong>Keys and Secrets</strong></h4>

<p>Once the Vault is created you can add in Keys and Secrets into the vault. This can be done by selecting the Vault that was just created from the Vaults list. From here you can manage different aspects of the Vault and also manage Keys and Secrets.</p>

<p><img  alt="Access Policy set Secret Permissions" src="/images/keyvaultportal_keyvault.png"/></p>

<p>The Azure Portal experience of Key Vault is good. It covers most of the functionalities needed when using a Key Vault. How do you find the new UI experience?</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Consistency is important in blogging. It does not matter if you are bad at writing, have nothing to write or nobody reads your blog. What matters is whether you write on a predictable schedule - once a month, once a week, once a year, one per day etc. If you do not have a schedule you are more likely to fall off from sticking to blogging. I had <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/own-your-urls/">written before</a>, I always struggled to write regularly. But since the start of this year, I have been blogging to a schedule (once a week) and have been successful with that. This post looks into some of the challenges that I faced and things that I have incorporated to stick to a schedule.</p>

</a></p>

<h3>Make Writing a Habit</h3>

<p>Writing posts was hard and I always procrastinated on it. It often took me more than a week to complete a post. There&rsquo;s a saying, <strong><em>If it hurts, do it more often</em></strong> - So to make writing easy I had to write more often.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>I write only when inspiration strikes. Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o&#8217;clock sharp.</em></p>

<p><em>- <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/302963-i-write-only-when-inspiration-strikes-fortunately-it-strikes-every">Somerset Maugham</a></em></p></blockquote>

<h4><strong>Generating Topics</strong></h4>

<p>Till a year back I struggled to find topics to blog. I did not find any &lsquo;cool thing&rsquo; that was worth blogging. Not much has changed even now on doing &lsquo;cool things&rsquo;. The only thing that changed was that I decided to write every day - no matter what I do or don&rsquo;t do.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>I have always struggled to find topics to blog, but then I realized all I need is to pay attention to things that I do daily</em></p></blockquote>

<p>A year back I asked <a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/about-simple-programmer/">John Somnez from SimpleProgrammer</a> the same question.</p>

<p><img  alt="email to John Somnez (SimpleProgrammer) on finding a blogging schedule" src="/images/bloggingSchedule_john_email.png"/></p>

<p>Though I did not get a reply from John, it kept me thinking. Late last year I started a Daily challenge of &lsquo;<em>Generating at least one blog topic a day</em>&rsquo; for a month. I did not have to write anything, just find a topic to blog and add it to a OneNote list. I did this for a month and found that I had enough topics to write on. Since the challenge did not have anything to do with writing, I did not restrict my thoughts. This is when I realized that it is not the lack of topics that I don&rsquo;t blog, but the fear of writing. That&rsquo;s when I started the &lsquo;Write Everyday&rsquo; daily challenge.</p>

<h4><strong>Write Everyday</strong></h4>

<p>This is one of the most important things that I found to be able to write posts regularly - <strong>Write Everyday</strong>. Yes every day, no matter what happens, I write at least one line towards a post. Since the goal is to <em>Write just one line for a blog post</em>, I hardly miss this goal. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Keeping the goal small and simple</a> is a trick that I picked from the book Mini Habits and find it useful. You can follow this for anything that you want to make a habit.</p>

<h4><strong>Make it Visible</strong></h4>

<p>Seeing something progressing to completion helps me to get it done faster. I used to write elsewhere and then copy it to my blog and publish it. This did not give me a sense of progression. I now have a <a href="/blog/optimizing-octopress-workflow-for-new-posts/">draft post workflow</a>, integrated with my blogging platform. I can preview this blog along with the draft posts on my laptop. This helps give a sense of progression and also makes the end goal visible.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Making your goal clear and visible helps you achieve it faster</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I also use this to keep track of new post ideas. Whenever I find a topic to blog, I add it as a draft. I add bullet points to the post whenever I get more thoughts on that topic. Once there are enough points to write about, I work on that post.</p>

<h3>Make Blogging All About Writing</h3>

<p>The last thing that I want is to get stuck with mundane repetitive tasks of publishing a post to get in the way of writing. The more regular I became in writing, I started noticing a lot of repetitive tasks in my blogging workflow. When you do any activity repetitively you notice tasks that you do over and over again. I started modifying my blog engine for my needs and to reduce manual effort.</p>

<h4><strong>Write in Advance</strong></h4>

<p>Having posts ready to be published is helpful as it gives the flexibility to slack a bit when in need. It&rsquo;s a great feeling to have blog posts ready to be published (right now I have posts ready for a month). I modified my blogging engine to support <a href="/blog/automatic_deployment_of_future_posts_with_octopress">publishing posts on future dates</a>. This helps me set publishing dates in the future for posts and it gets automatically deployed on the day. Automating the publishing helped make blogging more about writing. I can forget about it as soon as I complete a post by specifying the date I want it to be published and be rest assured that it will get published.</p>

<h4><strong>Make Writing Accessible</strong></h4>

<p>You never know when you have that free time and want to blog. Maybe it&rsquo;s while traveling, or waiting in a queue or at your work desk. You might be <a href="/blog/staying-productive-offline">offline or connected</a> Making it possible to write from irrespective of the kind of device (laptop, mobile, tablet) and connectivity was key for me. I have my draft posts synchronized through Dropbox and available on all my devices. This helps use all the pockets of time that I get for myself.</p>

<p>These are the things that have helped me pick a schedule and follow it. I have been successful in publishing one post per week for the past 10 months and want to keep at it going forward. Now that I am able to publish regularly, I want to improve the speed at which I write posts. Though I reduced the time from over a week to days, I still find this too long and want to reduce it to a day. Modifying the way images are added, optimized and served is also something that I am trying to optimize currently. Do you <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/own-your-urls/">have a blog</a>? If not start one and stick to a schedule that works for you!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>It&rsquo;s been six months with the <a href="http://amzn.to/2ddLmUf">Logitech MX Master</a> mouse and I absolutely love it for daily use. I picked this mouse a week after reading <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FindingThePerfectMouse.aspx">Hanselman&rsquo;s review</a>. It feels just as it sounded in his review - Perfect!.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-master">
    <img  alt="Logitech MX Master" src="/images/logitech_mxmaster.jpg"/>
</a></p>

<h4><strong>Key Features</strong></h4>

<ul>
<li><p>The mouse fits perfectly into the hand and supports the wrist in a native position. It is suitable for long duration use.</p></li>
<li><p>The battery is rechargeable and the mouse comes with a micro-USB charging cable. After a full charge, the mouse lasts me for 2-3 weeks.   The mouse can be used while charging, so there is no downtime. The LED lights indicate the charge status. If not the software also warns when the battery is low.</p></li>
<li><p>I connect the mouse using the Logitech Unifying Receiver. But the mouse also supports connecting over Bluetooth. This is useful in cases when you want to connect with multiple computers.</p></li>
<li><p>The mouse supports Easy Switch technology.  You can pair up to 3 devices and switch between them using buttons on the bottom side of the mouse. I have not used this feature as I mostly work on just one laptop.</p></li>
<li><p>Darkfield Laser Sensor tracks flawlessly over all surfaces. I use the MX Master across wooden and glass surfaces and find it smooth over both.</p></li>
<li><p>The mouse scroll supports smooth scrolling and &lsquo;Ratchet&rsquo; mode (click, click, click) scroll. It supports automatic and manual mode shifting. So when reading long documents you can be on smooth scrolling and when navigating code or shorter texts you can use Ratchet mode to feel greater control. It also has buttons to</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The mouse has an accompanying software that allows customizations of mouse buttons.</p>

<p><img  alt="Logitech MX Master Software" src="/images/logitech_mxmaster_software.png"/></p>

<p>The software allows setting application specific actions for buttons. For e.g. I have the Gesture button to archive emails in Outlook, &lsquo;Navigate to Definition&rsquo; in Visual Studio, close tab in Chrome etc. You can configure this to any action on applications of your choice (provided it supports keyboard shortcuts that can be linked to).</p>

<p><img  alt="Logitech MX Master Software customizations" src="/images/logitech_mxmaster_customize.png"/></p>

<h4><strong>Issue</strong></h4>

<p>The only issue that I faced so long is with the Mouse scroll mode. The &lsquo;Ratchet&rsquo; mode no longer works for me. It is always in smooth scrolling mode and the mechanical key to shift modes does not work anymore. Google tells me that this is a <a href="https://community.logitech.com/s/question/0D531000051026rCAA">common issue</a> with the mouse .
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR9fLd_ViYw">This video</a> walks through on how to open up the mouse and fix the mechanical part that clicks in to switch the scroll modes. I have not tried this myself as I don&rsquo;t feel much a problem without the Ratchet mode.</p>

<p>Other than the Ratchet mode issue, I have not found any other issues with the mouse.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Last month I was in Trivandrum (Kerala, India) for a month&rsquo;s vacation. This was also my first trip back to India after <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">moving to Sydney</a>. While in India I chose not to have a mobile connection and be offline on the go (at home I had a broadband connection). So while traveling places or moving around I had <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/">my mobile</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane_mode">airplane mode</a>. But even then there was time that I resorted to my mobile to spend time. When traveling by bus/train, afternoons in hotels (when everyone rests) etc, I had a lot of &lsquo;me time&rsquo;.</p>

<p><img  alt="Living an offline Life" src="/images/offlinelife.png"/></p>

<p>Below are some of the things that I have my phone geared up for offline mode.</p>

<h4><strong>Blogging</strong></h4>

<p>Blogging is one of the things that I enjoy doing most these days. To keep up with <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">my routine</a>, I try to blog every day to keep up with <a href="/blog/blogging-schedule/">my schedule</a>. I have modified <a href="/blog/optimizing-octopress-workflow-for-new-posts/">my blogging workflow</a> to give the flexibility to blog from any of my devices. Currently, I am writing this blog while on a train and &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline">disconnected</a>&rsquo;. When back home and connected, all the offline content synchronizes through Dropbox. The content written while offline is now available for <a href="/blog/continuos-delivery-of-octopress-blog-using-travisci-and-docker/">publishing from my laptop</a>. Making writing accessible from everywhere helps me to stick with my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">mini habits</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Reading</strong></h4>

<p>I always have books, articles downloaded and available for offline reading. For books, I use the Kindle application. Most of the time I have my Kindle for reading, if not I use the mobile application. For blog posts and articles I use Pocket. Whenever I am connected and find interesting posts to read later, I <a href="https://getpocket.com/add/?ep=1">Add to Pocket</a>. Pocket&rsquo;s mobile application <a href="https://help.getpocket.com/article/960-using-pocket-offline-on-android">downloads articles</a> and makes them available for offline reading.</p>

<p><img alt="Amazon Kindle and Pocket for offline reading" src="/images/offlinelife_reading.png"/></p>

<h4><strong>Game</strong></h4>

<p>I usually do not have many games on my mobile. But in case I feel bored I play the <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/09/25/chrome-t-rex-game/">game available on Chrome browser</a> (only in offline mode). When offline a T. Rex dinosaur comes up in the browser with the message &lsquo;Unable to connect to the Internet&rsquo;. Tapping on the dinosaur starts the game.</p>

<p><img  alt="Google Chrome offline T Rex game" src="/images/offlinelife_chrome_game.gif"/></p>

<h4><strong>To-Do List</strong></h4>

<p>Offline time is good to manage your To-Do lists and <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">do a brain dump</a>. I use Todoist to manage my tasks and activities. The <a href="https://support.todoist.com/hc/en-us/articles/205383721-Apps">Todoist mobile application</a> stores all tasks offline. It allows adding tasks when disconnected and synchronizes it to the server when connected. I also use OneNote for capturing notes which also has an offline mode.</p>

<h4><strong>Trip Planner</strong></h4>

<p>For short local trips, the recently launched <a href="https://get.google.com/trips/">Google Trips</a> is useful. Google Now already shows trip summaries and alerts on the home page. Google Trips takes this to the next level and allows to manage all trip data at one place. It helps collate all the travel booking in one place and makes it available in offline mode.</p>
