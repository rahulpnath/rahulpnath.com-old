  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Getting fit is one of the goals that I have set for myself this year. I have started running since mid of December and also controlling my diet.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>DISCLAIMER!</strong> I am not a doctor or a dietitian. The below are just my personal experiences and has worked for me. If you feel you have a medical problem or are in need of professional help, please contact a professional. Always consult a doctor before starting a new diet or exercise program.
</div>


<blockquote><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Have Parvathy (my wife) support me throughout.</li>
<li>Running 1-2 times a week</li>
<li>No carbs till Dinner: Smoothie, Veggies, and nuts till dinner. Dinner is Chappathi and curry (mostly vegetables).</li>
<li>150+ Pushups Daily, spread across the day</li>
<li>No Sugar</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I was around 95 kilos when I started out in December. At the time of writing, I weigh 82 kilos. Yes, I have lost 13 kilos over the past one and half months. This is the first time I have seen such drastic changes in my body, and I believe it&rsquo;s because of the strict diet more than anything. Below are the various aspects of what I have been following.</p>

<figure>
    <img alt="Before and After" src="/images/weigth_Before and After.jpg" />
    <figcaption><em>Here is the before and after.</em></figcaption>
</figure>


<h3>Exercises</h3>

<p> I started with running once a week. But now I am so into it I try to run two to three times a week. I use <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/users/4b76cfab-734e-1658-b5e4-600759a3b066">Runtastic</a> to track my runs. Last week I purchased the premium plan for Runtastic and looking forward to starting one of their 10k <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/training-plans/10k">training plans</a> and <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/results">runtastic results</a> on days that I do not run. I use a <a href="https://www.bose.com.au/en_au/products/headphones/earphones/soundsport-in-ear-headphones-audio.html#v=soundsport_ie_headphones_ii_audio_charcoal">Bose SoundSport in-ear audio only headphones</a>  headphones (the cheapest in their range) for music during the runs. Luckily Bose was running a half price on those models when I purchased.</p>

<p> I do push-ups every day and get 150+ (25 * 6+) every day. I split this out throughout the day - 75 before I head off to work and 75 once back. I get enough time in the morning to space it at 30-minute intervals as I <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">wake up at four</a>. I plan to replace push-ups with Runtastic Results starting next week.</p>

<p> <img alt="My Running History" src="/images/weight_running.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Diet</h3>

<p>Breakfast (<em>7:30 am</em>): Green Smoothie (+ eggs on days that I run) or Avocado and eggs.
Lunch (<em>12 pm</em>): Raw vegetables (Carrot, Cucumber, spinach, kale, beetroot, corn, sprouts)
Dinner (<em>6:30 pm</em>: Wheat Dosa or Chappathi + Vegetable Curry
Snacks: Anytime I feel hungry I have one of these - Nuts (Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, etc.), Carrot, Banana and Peanut butter. Usually, I end up having just the nuts at around 10 30 in the morning.</p>

<p><img alt="Diet" src="/images/weight_diet.jpg" /></p>

<p>When eating out, I keep an eye on carbs and other junk. Try to eat grilled instead of fried. Usually, we eat out on weekends as we will be traveling places. We usually have a hearty lunch on weekends. Parvathy and I decided to have fruits for dinner on those days. I try to take fruits that contain less sugar like kiwi, berries, etc. But we do have apples, mangoes, watermelon, etc. but in moderation. The fruit choices are more driven by what&rsquo;s available at the place <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">I live now</a>.</p>

<p>Sugar: I try my best to avoid it fully. To start with I quit tea and coffee. Believe me, I was a tea addict and I needed lots of it. It was hard, but then Parvathy quit it one day, and I got inspired by her. I still remember that last tea I took when I decided I am having no more of it. It&rsquo;s hard but doable!. I don&rsquo;t have any ice-cream, fruit juice, carbonated drinks, energy drinks, pastries, etc.</p>

<h3>Family Outings</h3>

<p>We used to spend a lot of our weekends in shopping malls till a while back. We decided to change that to more of outdoor activities. So it&rsquo;s either the beach, boating, parks, walks, etc. This has increased our general activity levels and help burn extra calories. And mostly I have &lsquo;an extra weight&rsquo; to carry around; you can tell that from the photos :). Gautham also enjoys these outdoor activities, and there&rsquo;s more for him to learn in each of those short trips. On weekdays we go for a walk after dinner, shop around for groceries, etc. and run any other errands so that we are free during weekends.</p>

<p>With the new routine, I now feel great to be back in shape. I have never been this light since a long time, and I am happy to be in clothes that I had locked up in my bags. Since the new routine takes an hour out of <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">my morning routine</a> I have to optimize myself further to keep up with blogging, videos and learning new things. I am still trying to find a balance but for this. Hoping to continue with this new routine.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/quick-launch-in-visual-studio/" itemprop="url">Tip of the Week: Quick Launch in Visual Studio</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><img alt="Visual Studio Quick Launch" src="/images/visualstudio_quicklaunch.png" /></p>

<p>As a .NET developer, I spent the majority of my time in Visual Studio. Knowing to navigate fast within the IDE or quickly find what I want is important. Many times finding specific settings or navigating to individual windows can take a while, especially if you are not familiar with it and don&rsquo;t know exactly where to look. Visual Studio has a quick launch toolbar that is designed exactly for this. Be it opening the Package Manager Console or changing the font style you can use the quick launch to search and navigate to it.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>You can use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh417697.aspx">Quick Launch</a> to quickly search and execute actions for IDE assets such as options, templates, menus. You can&rsquo;t use Quick Launch to search for code and symbols. The Quick Launch search box is located at the top-right corner of the menu bar and is accessible by choosing the <strong>Ctrl+Q</strong> keys.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The added advantage is that you can use the quick launch bar to <strong><em>learn new keyboard shortcuts</em></strong>. Searching for an item also shows the keyboard shortcut for it next to it. Over time you can remember the direct keyboard shortcut and avoid quick launch as well.</p>

<p><img alt="Visual Studio Quick Launch learn keyboard shortcuts" src="/images/visualstudio_quicklaunch_keyboardShortcuts.png" /></p>

<p>Knowing the tools that you use is an important part of development. Able to navigate fast within the IDE enables to remove any time wasted poking around the IDE. Use that time to read and write code.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/avoid-state-mutation/" itemprop="url">Avoid State Mutation</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>How many times have you had to navigate down a long chain of function calls to find out that some code deep down was changing the value of an object passed to it? The change could either be setting the value to null or modifying the value in itself. When passing around reference types, it&rsquo;s easy to run into this situation very often.  This happens not just when debugging existing code, but also when looking at the code we have just finished writing. Maintaining state transitions and object state based on the order in which functions are invoked on them can soon become confusing and buggy. So the best way is to try and avoid them in the first place.</p>

<p><img alt="Avoid State Mutation" src="/images/mutation.png" /></p>

<h3>What is state Mutation</h3>

<p>The process of changing the value of a variable or an object over time after creation is called mutation. In simpler terms when you are changing the value of an object, you are mutating the state. I am sure that everyone would have had some time getting their head around the below statement when starting off with programming (I did)</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By second nature (depending on the programming languages one is exposed to e.g. csharp, java, etc.) you would say the above statement is perfectly fine and not think twice about anything. But show it to someone who is new to programming. They will find it hard to understand those two statements, the same phase that we have all gone through. &lsquo;=&rsquo; has turned into an assignment operator while it is an equality operator in mathematics. There are languages where &lsquo;=&rsquo; still stands for equality (like FSharp). In the example above the value of x is mutated - it is changed from 1 to 2.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The process of actually changing a variable’s value over time, within a single context, is called mutation.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Risks of Mutation</h3>

<p>Mutable types can pose risks when passing a mutable value as function parameters or when returning mutable values from functions.</p>

<h4><strong>Passing Mutable Value</strong></h4>

<p>Let us take a simple example below. I have a list of integers, and I want to check if the first item of the incoming list and the sorted one are same. I have a simple sort method which implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Bubble sort</a>. What do you think will be the output?</p>

<p>Yes, it prints out the message that the <em>First item is in place</em>. Before getting into the details of the issue, let us set our expectations correct. When calling the Sort method, we do not expect it to change the contents of the original list. Given that the function&rsquo;s signature is that of a Query (returns a value), we expect it not to create any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science">side effects</a>). According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation">Command Query Separation</a> (CQS) by Bertrand Meyer in <a href="http://amzn.to/2hZ4P9C">Object Oriented Software Construction</a></p>

<blockquote><p><em>Every method should either be a command that performs an action, or a query that returns data to the caller, but not both. In other words, Asking a question should not change the answer. More formally, methods should return a value only if they are referentially transparent and hence possess no side effects.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Applying CQS means that any method can either be a Query or a Command. A command changes the state of the system but does not return a value (void). A query does not change the state of the system and returns a value and should be idempotent. Such functions are also referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure functions</a>. The above Sort function only partially confirms to being a query. It does return the same output given the same input, the sorted list. But it changes the state of the system and has side effects - it mutates the list passed. The issue in the implementation of the Sort is that it casts the list passed in as <em>IList<int></em>, if it is already one. So when the parameter list is of type IList, listEvaluated points to the same list. If you force copy the list irrespective of it being a list or not will fix the issue. I will discuss more on how this kind of a conditional evaluation got in here in a separate post.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">listEvaluated</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ToList</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This kind of change is only possible if the development team owns the Sort function. If this is a third-party library that you are consuming then the only way to avoid the problem will be to send in a copy of the list. Even trying to pass the list <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e78dcd75(v=vs.110).aspx">AsReadOnly</a> will not work here. Check it out if you are not sure why.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The above solution does not imply that every time we need to pass in a list to a function we should defensively copy it (using ToList). <em>It depends</em>. Within a development team, there can be a convention that it sticks to CQS principle. In case of exceptions, make sure that it is communicated to everyone. Communication to developers is done best by naming the function to reflect that or adding a comment that shows up in the IDE intellisense (if any). For code that you consume from third parties or open sources make sure you understand well how the library behaves and check the documentation before using it. Ensure you have <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/tdd/">unit tests</a> asserting the assumptions and behavior in all cases.</p>

<h4><strong>Returning Mutable Values</strong></h4>

<p>Let us take an example to see the possible effects of returning mutable values from a function. Below is a configuration helper class which returns a configuration object. The helper method is used in three different places of the application shown as <em>config1, config2, config3</em>. In one of the cases, the business logic requires the Duration value to be twice that in configuration. Since the real configuration helper reaches out to the database for its values, it was decided to cache the values after the first call. The ConfigurationHelper uses &lsquo;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton Pattern</a></em> to achieve the caching Below is the implementation. Do you see any problems?</p>

<p>The first caller will get the configuration value 1, as expected. The second caller also gets the configuration value 1, but it goes on to set the value as two times, so it becomes 2. The third caller, which does not have any idea of the second caller or its specific business requirements also gets the configuration value as 2. They get a wrong configuration because the second caller updated the same object that the ConfigurationHelper holds. Again this is a side effect of how the ConfigurationHelper returns the configuration. There are two or more ways to solve this problem. The ConfigurationHelper class can return a new instance of the Configuration class every time someone requests for it. To return a new instance requires removing the private variable and the conditional check associated with it. Removing the check is similar to the defensive copying that we discussed in the previous example and also every call to get the configuration, now needs to hit the database. One could argue that only one caller mutates the object and it is unnecessary to create a new instance for the rest. We can remove the public setter&rsquo;s on the Configuration class properties. Without a setter, the second caller cannot change the Duration property of the Configuration class. Removing the setter means that we add a constructor as well to take in the parameters that it requires as below.</p>

<p>The above ensures that nobody can change the value of the configuration object once created. So the second caller can longer assign the new duration value to the same object. If it wants to continue using a configuration object it needs to create a new Configuration object with the new duration. If there are more properties on the configuration object you can create extension methods like WithDuration to create a new Configuration class copying all the values as is from the old object and replace just the Duration.</p>

<p>As we have seen the above two cases, mutation can cause undesired effects unless those are intended for. It does not mean that mutating is bad and you should stop it immediately. But if you start writing your code using immutable types, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/thinking-beyond-primitive-values-value-objects/">Value Objects</a>, etc. you will slowly move to a point where you no longer need to mutate values. When you do not mutate state, it is easier to reason about code. You no longer need to wade through those method calls to find who is changing the value of a property. Immutability is one of the key features of functional languages and changes how programs are written. You take away most of the problems involved in multi-threading when a function can no longer mutate the state of the object. So the next time you make change check if you are changing the state of the object, think twice and see if you can find a way around!</p>

  </header>

<p>I have been using Cmder as my command line for around two years and been loving it. I am not a super user of the command line, but try to use it more and more.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of good console emulator on Windows. It is based on ConEmu with major config overhaul, comes with a Monokai color scheme, and a custom prompt layout.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This is not right with Windows 10, as there is a new command prompt which has a lot more features. I have not yet thought of moving to that as Cmder has been working well for me.</p>

<h4><strong>Installation and setting up</strong></h4>

<p>Cmder is open source and free to download from <a href="http://cmder.net/">Cmder.net</a>. One of the advantages of Cmder is its portability. You can carry it with you on a USB stick or in the Cloud, so all your settings can go anywhere you go. Installation is simple, all you need to do is download the latest release, extract the archive and run Cmder executable. Check out the documentation if you face any difficulties.</p>

<h4><strong>Features I Like</strong></h4>

<p>Able to <strong><em>paste into the console using the Windows shortcut Ctrl + V</em></strong> is one of the key things that got me started with this command line tool. It also supports most of the other text traversal keyboard shortcuts of Windows.</p>

<p>Cmder supports <strong><em>multiple console tabs within a window</em></strong>. Tabs makes having multiple consoles open and managing them easy. All tab manipulation has associated keyboard shortcuts making it even faster. When creating a new tab, using Ctrl + T, you can choose to run different predefined tasks on command line startup. You can also set the user and user rights to run them as. Setting up the predefined tasks is under Settings -> Startup->Tasks.  I have added <strong><em>custom tasks</em></strong> for PowerShell, and Visual Studio developer command prompt as that is what I use mostly.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong><em>Alias</em></strong> is one of the key features that keeps me to Cmder. You can create short commands to map to longer commands. Aliases avoid typing long commands every time you want to perform that action. You can see all existing aliases by running alias command. I use this feature a lot. Most of the git commands are aliases, so I do not have to type them every time. For e.g., when on a git repository I can type <em>gs</em> to run git status. You can also pass arguments to alias. To do a git commit with a message I run <em>gc The commit message</em>. Aliases support optional parameters through the $1-9 or the $*.</p>

<p>To define a alias <em>alias gs=git status</em>. Below are some of the alias examples.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Screencast helps to connect with people in a different way and adds a personal touch (sound and visual). It makes learning new things faster, by seeing it in action. Most of the fine details (which can be missed while writing a blog post) get captured in screencasting and this helps in better understanding. I have been long wanting to create screencasts and start a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RahulNath">YouTube channel</a>. Finally, this <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/2016-recap/">happened in 2016</a> and here is how the recording experience went.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast">screencast</a> is a digital recording of computer screen output, also known as a video screen capture, often containing audio narration.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Presentation</h3>

<p>I chose to do my first screencast as a slide share presentation, as it was something that I was comfortable with. Since there are not many videos on <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/azure-key-vault/">Azure Key Vault</a> and I have been blogging extensively about it, I didn&rsquo;t have to think twice about the topic. I scripted the whole presentation, to every word that I would say. Scripting for a video is different from writing a blog post as it has to be conversational with a video. Also, there are a lot more details that need to be covered and talked about as it is all visible on the recording.</p>

<p>Since I did not have an external monitor I wanted a presentation application that allows presenter notes and syncs them across multiple devices. This would allow me to record the screen and read off the presenter notes side by side. <a href="http://slides.com/">Slides</a> had exactly what I wanted. It allows to add presenter notes for each slide and allows <a href="http://help.slides.com/knowledgebase/articles/333925-remote-control">remote controlling</a> the presentation from multiple devices. So I can launch it as a full-screen presentation on my laptop for recording screen and have an iPad or mobile launch the same presentation as a presenter where the notes show up. This helped me follow the script while recording the video. It would have been much easier with multiple monitors, but I just did not want to get one just for this and I have been trying to get used with a single screen. Alternatively, I could have taken a printout of the script.</p>

<h3>Microphone</h3>

<p>An external microphone is absolutely necessary to record your sound well. The microphone that comes built into the laptop is not suited for recording good quality audio. It picks a lot more of the background noises, room noise, typing etc and creates a lot of disturbance in the recording. There are a lot of options available when it comes to getting an external microphone. Most of the microphones are either <a href="http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/best-condenser-mics/">Condenser Mics</a> or <a href="http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/dynamic-studio-microphone/">Dynamic Mics</a>. Microphones also have different connectivity options like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLR_connector">XLR</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB">USB</a> etc. For a home recording setup USB is easier to get started with so I decided to get one with a <a href="http://ehomerecordingstudio.com/usb-microphones/">USB connectivity</a>.</p>

<p>I got the <a href="http://www.rode.com/microphones/podcaster">Rode Podcaster</a> with a <a href="http://www.rode.com/accessories/psa1">boom arm</a> and <a href="http://www.rode.com/accessories/psm1">shock mount</a>. The Rode Podcaster is a dynamic USB mic and is a popular choice amongst many people out there. It&rsquo;s a bit higher on the price side (depends on your budget though) but delivers great value. It cuts off most of the room noise and takes in only your voice which is exactly what I wanted. You need to get really close into the mic, so a boom arm helps.</p>

<p><img alt="Screencast Microphone, Rode Podcaster" src="/images/screencast_microphone_rode.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>Choosing the software was much easier than getting the microphone. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/au/products/premiere.html?sdid=VBF1KRFN&amp;mv=search&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!107609177344!e!!g!!adobe%20premiere&amp;ef_id=Ve-MSAAABFDV-qvS:20170101175215:s">Adobe Premiere</a> or <a href="http://shop.techsmith.com/store/techsm/en_AU/pd/productID.289432000">Camtasia</a> are the most popular screen recording software&rsquo;s in the windows world. I have a lot of friends already using Camtasia and was happy with it. So I decided to stick with Camtasia and bought a license (Thanks to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">Readify&rsquo;s</a> Software Allowance, I did not have to spend a lot from my pocket).</p>

<p>For recording audio, I use <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, which is an open source software and available free of cost. I am yet to learn some audio processing techniques and for now just use noise removal, amplify and compression. Also since the Rode microphone does not pick a lot of external noise the audio did not require much processing. At first, I tried recording with a <a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/gomic/">Samson GO mic</a> but felt that it picked it a lot more room noise and it needed a lot more audio processing.</p>

<h3>Recording</h3>

<p>With the hardware and software sorted now comes the hardest part of it all - Recording!!. I knew there would be difficulties along the way, but never thought it would be this hard. After reading around I understood that a popular technique that people use for recording is to record the audio and video separately for webcasts/screen recordings. I decide to take the same approach but just that did it in the wrong order (which I found after the first recording). For my first video I did the video first and the audio later. This meant that I recorded my screen performing all the slide movements and the code sample demo and then tried to fit the audio onto it. This was the biggest mistake in my complete recording, but I realized it only towards the end of the recording. Recording video was easy but fitting in the sound to it was hard. I had to do multiple (innumerous) takes and have to stop so often every now and then. And since I am yet to learn <em>how to talk naturally when in front of a microphone</em>, my voice was all over the place. Some bits had more bass, some a bit low others high, some fast others slow. I struggled with it for a long time and finally somehow got to get it all together. But though it was nowhere close to the quality that I set out for or would love to have in videos that I watch, I decided to ship it. For the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbshGF4ZwGE">second recording</a>, I recorded the audio first and then fitted in the video onto it. This was so much easier and I have a more consistent voice in that, though there is a noticeable change in the middle.</p>

<p>I am planning to do more recordings in the upcoming months so that I get more comfortable with it. <strong><em>If it hurts, do it more often</em></strong>. Kindly leave your feedback on the videos.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><img alt="Keyboard Shortcuts" src="/images/keyboard_shortcuts.jpg" /></p>

<p>I prefer to use the keyboard to navigate within sites I use frequently. Keyboard enables to navigate faster within site and perform tasks quicker. The <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-six-months-and-counting-logitech-mx-master/">Logitech MX Master</a> mouse provides a lot of capabilities to navigate. But I find the keyboard faster to perform repetitive actions - like posting a new status update on social media sites, managing tasks in Jira, TFS online, GitHub, responding to emails, Todoist, etc. Finding keyboard shortcuts on these various sites can itself be a daunting task. One might need to google to get the shortcuts or find the relevant documentation on the site. Luckily most of the popular sites today display a pop-up modal with all the keyboard shortcuts for the site when pressing <strong>Shift + ?</strong>. Note that this might not work on all the sites out there. But for most of the common ones that I use l, I find it working.</p>

<p>So the next time you spend a lot of time on a website try hitting <strong>Shift + ?</strong> to look for supported keyboard shortcuts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>If you are the kind of person that likes to listen to some music while working, then this one is for you. Music is proven to have significant effects on improving focus while working. But it is also quite possible to get fully immersed in the music and forget all about work. Different kinds of music contribute to improving concentration while not getting immersed in the music itself. I usually <a href="http://theheadphonesrule.com/">wear my headphones</a> at work while working and listen to music.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Music helps to minimize distractions and helps you reach a state of <a href="http://amzn.to/2jlYIgV">Flow</a>, which is ideal for improving productivity.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>At times I like to hear to just some background noises simulating different environments. <a href="https://www.noisli.com/">Noisli</a> is an application that helps mix different sounds and create your perfect environment. The sounds could either be working in a restaurant or while it&rsquo;s raining with thunder, in a forest, by the side of the fire, etc. It helps create the mood that you want and helps recreate it with sound. Since the noises are of a fixed pattern, you soon get used to it and improves concentration at work.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>At one of my clients, we were facing an issue of missing some part of a form data when processing a <em>Submit</em> request on the form. As per the current design, the form autosaves data to the database as and when user types in. When the user finally submits the form to be processed the Controller gets all the relevant data from the database and sends for processing. But we noticed that the processing requests missed parts of data in the request send for processing even though the database had those values. This was a clear case where the forms submit request got processed even before all the forms data was saved. The UI was enabling the Submit button right after all the UI validations were made and asynchronously firing off saves to the database.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not go into the design discussion of whether the UI should be sending in all the data to be processed as part of the Submit request as opposed to just sending a reference id and have the controller get all the data from the database (which it is currently doing). The quick fix for this problem was to enable the submit button only after all the asynchronous save requests (the ones for autosave) came back with a success response. The fix was simple but testing this was a challenge.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>We wanted to delay a few HTTP requests to check how the UI behaved</em></p></blockquote>

<p>When using automated tests there are a lot of frameworks that can help delay requests. But in this case, we were relying on manual tests.</p>

<h3>Using Fiddler to Delay Requests</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> is an HTTP debugging proxy server application, that captures HTTP and HTTPS traffic and displays to the user. It is one of the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">tools that I use almost every other day</a>. In Fiddler, we can create rules on web requests and modify how they are handled and responded. Most of the functionality is available under the <a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/KnowledgeBase/AutoResponder#latency">AutoResponder</a> tab. We had seen earlier how to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/using-fiddler-to-help-in-manual-testing/">compose web requests and also simulate error conditions in Fiddler</a>. Here we will see how to use Fiddler to delay request/response time. In Fiddler, we can either delay the request itself being sent to the server or delay the handover of response back to the calling application once it is received from the server.</p>

<h4><strong>Delay</strong></h4>

<p>By setting <a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/KnowledgeBase/AutoResponder#delay">delay</a> on a request we can specify the time to delay sending the request to the server. The value is specified in milliseconds. When a request that <a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/KnowledgeBase/AutoResponder#matching-rules">matches</a> the condition set (in this case an EXACT match with a URL) fiddler delays sending this request to the server by the set amount of time.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Delay sending request to the server by #### of milliseconds</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Drag&#8217;n Drop the request the URL (1) into the AutoResponder tab (2) and from the dropdown (3) under the Rule Editor choose delay and set the delay time. Click Save (4). Make sure that the request and rules are enabled (5 &amp; 6).</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Posts per month - 2016" src="/images/fiddler_delay.png"/></p>

<h4><strong>Latency</strong></h4>

<p>By setting <a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/KnowledgeBase/AutoResponder#latency">latency</a> on a request we can specify the delay before a response is received. When a request that <a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/KnowledgeBase/AutoResponder#matching-rules">matches</a> the condition set fiddler sends the requests to the server immediately. Once the response is received it delays passing the response back to the calling application by the set delay time in milliseconds.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Induce a delay (latency) before a response is returned.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Drag&#8217;n Drop the request URL (1) into the AutoResponder tab (2). Right click on the URL and select &lsquo;Set Latency&rsquo; (3). Enter the latency time in milliseconds and OK. Make sure that rules and latency options are enabled (4 &amp; 5)</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Posts per month - 2016" src="/images/fiddler_latency.png"/></p>

<p>Using these options we delayed all the autosave requests going off the form. This delayed saving the data in the database and the forms Submit request once processed did not have all the required data. It also helped us test after the fix and helped ensure that the submit button was enabled only after all form data was saved. In both the above examples, I chose EXACT match condition to set the delay/latency. This will delay only the specific requests. To modify all the requests you can use a different regex match condition. To simulate a random time delay or latency among different requests you can even use <a href="http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/KnowledgeBase/FiddlerScript/ModifyRequestOrResponse">Fiddler Scripting</a> and set the delay time using a random number. This helps simulate a slow internet connection scenario and test how the application responds to it.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I share a lot of information copying and pasting from websites. Most of the times I want to share just the text and not any formatting. To remove any text formatting, I copy it into Notepad and then onto the destination. Yesterday I found that using <strong>Ctrl + Shift + V</strong> to paste (instead of <em>Ctrl + V</em>) removes all text formatting.</p>

<p>As shown, when using Ctrl + V the text gets copied along with the formatting as shown below.</p>

<p><img alt="Paste With Formatting" src="/images/paste_with_formatting.png" /></p>

<p>When using Ctrl + Shift + V, only the text gets copied and the formatting is ignored.
<img alt="Paste Without Formatting" src="/images/paste_without_formatting.png" /></p>

<p>Using this shortcut saves time as I no longer need to open Notepad for this!</p>

<p>PS: As one of my readers rightly pointed out (below in the comments), this might not work on all applications. I have tried this on Chrome Browser and Lync For Business and worked fine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Code review is an essential practice of the development life cycle. It helps improve the code quality, unify team practices, share knowledge, mentoring etc. over a longer period of time. It helps find mistakes that are overlooked while developing and helps improve the overall quality of the software. This helps accelerate the deployment process as changes are more likely to pass through testing.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Peer review—an activity in which people other than the author of a software deliverable examine it for defects and improvement opportunities—is one of the most powerful software quality tools available. Peer review methods include inspections, walkthroughs, peer desk checks, and other similar activities.</em></p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Posts per month - 2016" src="/images/codereview_friendly.png"/></p>

<p>Below are some of my thoughts on the various aspects involved in a Code Review.</p>

<h3>Sending a Review</h3>

<p>Before sending for a code review make sure that only the necessary files for the change are added in the review. Often it happens that when we write code there are remains of things that we tried and discarded, like new files, packages, changes to project metadata files etc. Double check and make sure that the changes are what are just required. Ensure that the code builds successfully. If there are any build scripts that your team uses, make sure that those are run and passes successfully. When submitting a code review make sure that you reference the associated work item - be it a bug, story, task etc. Add <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/testing/">tests</a>. Add in a description detailing the change and any reasoning behind it to add in more context. This will help the reviewer understand the code much faster. Add in relevant people for the review and submit a request. Check out <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/01/15/10-tips-for-better-pull-requests/">some great tips for a better-looking review request</a>.</p>

<h3>Handling Review Comments</h3>

<p>One of the key things in a code review and one that&rsquo;s often missed and drives people frustrated is that they try to take it all in.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Not all comments in a review needs to be addressed</em></p></blockquote>

<p>If a review comment points out a mistake in logic or business functionality or conflict with other code you need to fix them, unless you think the reviewer is wrong. But for suggestions on how better to structure your code or refactor into a more readable code, naming, style formatting etc needs addressing only if you feel they are adding value. But make sure to communicate well with the reviewer and reach an agreement.</p>

<p>Look at comments as a way to improve your code and help the team and business. Go in with a positive attitude. When seen as an overhead or an extra ritual, code reviews can be really painful and depressing. Make a note of commonly occurring comments or mistakes you are making and try to handle them at the time of development. Rather than mechanically going through the code review and making changes to the code, internalize on the change and try to see the benefits of a change. This helps to incorporate such suggestions in future reviews as well.</p>

<h3>Responding to a Code Review</h3>

<p>I usually find myself following the below three variations when coming to replying to a code review request</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comment and Wait</strong>
I leave comments on the review but do not approve. This means that I would like to have those comments actioned and a new pull request be raised for that. This often falls into those cases where there are logic or business issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comment and Approve</strong>
I leave comments (if any) but also approve the code review. This means that the code <em>Looks Good To Me</em> (LGTM), but would be better with the comments addressed. These comments generally relate to better formatting, improved on naming or refactoring readability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add Relevant People</strong>
Add in reviewers that I feel are missed and relevant for the part of the code that is changed.  This I do irrespective of the above two options if I feel someone else needs to take a look. In these cases, if it was my review that gets added in an extra reviewer I would wait to get a sign off from that person too.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4><strong>Business Aspect</strong></h4>

<p>When reviewing code look first for the functionality that the code change addresses. It is possible that we get carried away just by the technical aspect of code and ignore the business aspect altogether. If you have <a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/2014/09/acceptance-criteria/">Acceptance Criteria</a> defined for tasks then it&rsquo;s worth reading it before doing the code review to get more context.</p>

<h4><strong>Technical aspect</strong></h4>

<p>Once the business aspect is covered have a look at the technical aspect of the change. Whether the code is decoupled, has the correct abstractions, follows team conventions (best if automated). Check for commonly occurring problems like improper usage of dispose pattern, magic numbers, large methods, all code flow paths not handled etc. See if the new code fits into the overall architecture of the application. Look for tests and ensure the validity of the test data. Look out for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overengineering">overengineering</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">not invented here syndrome</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Aesthetic</strong></h4>

<p>Code formatting is as important as the code itself. Code is read more often than written, so we should try and optimize code for reading. I would prefer to automate this as far as possible so that people don&rsquo;t need to look for these in reviews. I feel that is often time not well spent and also tends to lead to longer discussions (<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/death-to-the-space-infidels/">tabs vs Spaces</a>). When it is part of the build and automated people seldom complain about it and in a very short period of time, the formatting rules become second nature to them. If you currently do not have automated checks you can gradually <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/introducing-code-formatting-into-a-large-codebase/">introduce formatting checks into your builds for a large code base</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Don&rsquo;t go by &lsquo;It&rsquo;s done like that everywhere so I will keep it the same&rsquo;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>There might be a lot of practices that is being followed over the period of time. But if you find any of the practices making it harder on a day-to-day functioning of the team, take a step towards changing the practice. I am not a fan of &lsquo;<em>clean it all at once</em>&rsquo; style of approach. I prefer to gradually introduce the change for two reasons</p>

<ul>
<li>No need to stop or allocate people to repeatedly do the same task of cleaning it everywhere. (Unless there is a very strong business justification to it)</li>
<li>You get gradually introduced to the new way of doing things. This gives time to reflect and compare with the old way. You have time to correct yourself if the new approach is not fitting well either or causing more trouble than previous.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Handling Conflicts</h3>

<p><img class="center" alt="Posts per month - 2016" src="/images/codereview_wtf.png"/></p>

<p>Foster environments where you don&rsquo;t curb discussions or other people&rsquo;s ideas but encourage everyone to actively participate and throw around even the stupidest of an idea.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Psychological safety is a “shared belief, held by members of a team, that the group is a safe place for taking risks.” It is “a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up,” Edmondson wrote in a 1999 paper. “It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.</em></p>

<p>Code reviews should also be seen as a way to incorporate better practices from fellow developers and as a learning mechanism. Don&rsquo;t take comments personal, but look at it for what they are. When you have a conflicting opinion you can reply to the comment with your thoughts and cross check with the reviewer. Rarely it can happen that you have conflicting opinions on code review comments and you are not able to solve it among the people involved.  Walk up to the person (if you are co-located) or have a conversation over your teams messaging application. But make sure that it stays healthy. In case the discussion is not going the intended way you can involve senior team members or other fellow team members to seek their opinions too. If such kinds of conflicts are happening more often then the team needs to analyze the nature of review comments that these occur on, if it&rsquo;s between specific groups of people or any visible patterns and try to address them.</p>

<p>When taken in isolation any practices that a team does take time. So disregard any activity just because it adds more time to your process. When seen as part of the overall development cycle and the benefits it brings to the business, Code Reviews proves to be an essential practice. Different teams tend to have different guidelines and checklists for the reviews. Follow what works best for your team. Do you do code reviews as part of your development cycle? What do you feel important in a Code Review? Sound off in the comments!</p>
