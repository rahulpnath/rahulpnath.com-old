      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/psm-learnings/" itemprop="url">Learnings from The Professional Scrum Master (PSM) Course</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Last month I attended the Professional Scrum Master (PSM) training. <a href="https://twitter.com/rbanks54">Richard Banks</a> was the training instructor who also happens to be my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">colleague at Readify</a>. It is a two days training and was a great experience for me. It changed my perception towards Scrum. Before the training, I was not that fascinated about Scrum and often argued against it citing that it&rsquo;s development practices that we need to uphold more and not Scrum. After the training, I have still not changed on the latter part but have changed my perception towards Scrum. Here are some of the key takeaways for me from the training.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Stick to the Process</li>
<li>Make Daily Scrum (a.k.a Standup) effective by setting mini goals</li>
<li>Understand the different Roles and imbibe the responsibilities</li>
<li>Have a well-defined Definition for Done</li>
<li>Deliver value in every sprint</li>
<li>Foster team collaboration and openness</li>
<li>Scrum is not the Silver Bullet. Other development practices must be followed in parallel.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are completely new to Scrum or not so familiar with the different terms used I recommend that you read <a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">The Scrum Guide</a>. Don&rsquo;t refrain from clicking that link thinking it is a long book. It is a short one, and you can finish it in less than an hour. It is an hour well spent!</p>

<p><img alt="Scrum Framework" src="/images/scrum_framework.png" /></p>

<h3>Sticking to the Process</h3>

<p>Everyone who was attending the training was already using Scrum, <em>but..</em> This is one of the common things with mostly everything and specifically with Scrum. People take parts of it and change the system to suit their needs. This is fine as long as you have tried the original process long enough to understand the pros and cons of it.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Tweaking the process to suit existing practices as soon as you start with a new process is just <strong>resistance to change</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Like Uncle Bob Martin says in clean code, dedicate yourself to the process and follow it religiously until you have mastered the process. You can start modifying the process or finding new ways once you have reached that state. But till then follow it religiously if you want to see any benefit.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Martial artists do not all agree about the best martial art, or the best technique within a martial art. Often master martial artists will form their own schools of thought and gather students to learn from them. So we see Gracie Jiu Jistu, founded and taught by the Gracie family in Brazil. We see Hakkoryu Jiu Jistu, founded and taught by Okuyama Ryuho in Tokyo. We see Jeet Kune Do, founded and taught by Bruce Lee in the United States.</em></p>

<p><em>Students of these approaches immerse themselves in the teachings of the founder.They dedicate themselves to learn what that particular master teaches, often to the exclusion of any other master’s teaching. Later, as the students grow in their art, they may become the student of a different master so they can broaden their knowledge and practice. Some eventually go on to refine their skills, discovering new techniques and founding their own schools. None of these different schools is absolutely right. Yet within a particular school we act as though the teachings and techniques are right. After all, there is a right way to practice Hakkoryu Jiu Jitsu, or Jeet Kune Do. But this rightness within a school does not invalidate the teachings of a different school.</em></p>

<p><em>-Uncle Bob Martin, <a href="http://amzn.to/2kCHgVz">Clean Code</a></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Effectiveness of Daily Scrum</h3>

<p>Daily Scrum or otherwise popular as Standup meetings are <strong>not about standing up to give status updates</strong>. The intent of the Daily Scrum is for the development team to get together and work out whatever is required to get closer to the goal set for the sprint. Standing up improves your activity levels and interaction levels. So it&rsquo;s recommended to stand up. The primary intent of the fifteen minutes time-boxed event (it can take no more than the allotted time) is to look at how we tracked on with our &lsquo;mini goals&rsquo; from last daily scrum and setting new &lsquo;mini goals&rsquo; till next stand up. Also, capture any impediments or blockers and make sure that there are assigned people following up on it. The daily scrum necessarily needs not be the first thing in the morning but is usually preferred. Currently, I am on an evening 4 pm daily scrum.</p>

<h3>Roles and Their Importance</h3>

<p>Understanding of the different roles in Scrum is necessary. A scrum team consists of</p>

<ul>
<li>The Product Owner</li>
<li>Scrum Master</li>
<li>Development team</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><em>Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Most important is to understand the responsibilities of each role and adhere to it as much as possible. Remember Sticking to the Process is important. Each of the roles must have the courage and openness to act according to their role responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Definition of Done</h3>

<p>Having a prior agreed on Definition of Done is important to decide when a piece of work is done. Having a common understanding of the definition of done ensures that we do not ship half-baked features. It also provides a guide for non-functional features, which often gets sidelined or missed and later becomes a show-stopper.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of “Done” will expand to include more stringent criteria for higher quality. Any one product or system should have a definition of “Done” that is a standard for any work done on it.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Delivering Value</h3>

<p>One of the golden rules is that every sprint must produce an increment that adds some business value. It need not be released to production, but it must be production ready. The Product Owner makes release decisions.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This hints that having sprints solely for handling Technical debts, Refactoring, Project setup, Infrastructure setup, etc. are not recommended.</p>

<h3>Team collaboration and Effectiveness</h3>

<p>The process heavily depends on the people encompassing The Scrum Team. So it is important to have a good rapport amongst the team members. The team members should be comfortable and open with each other. The team needs to be self-organizing. When starting with Scrum, this might not be the case, and the team must recognize this and work towards self-organizing. The Scrum Master must encourage and guide the team to reach that state of independence.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>When the values of commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of <strong>transparency, inspection, and adaptation</strong> come to life and build trust for everyone.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><img alt="Scrum Values" src="/images/scrum_values.png" /></p>

<p>The Scrum Guide calls out the above five core values that a team should demonstrate for the effectiveness of the framework. The Scrum team should constantly try to demonstrate these core values and try to improve on this.</p>

<h3>Not the Silver Bullet for Development</h3>

<blockquote><p><em>There&rsquo;s a mess I&rsquo;ve heard about with quite a few projects recently. It works out like this:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>They want to use an agile process, and pick Scrum</em></li>
<li><em>They adopt the Scrum practices, and maybe even the principles</em></li>
<li><em>After a while progress is slow because the code base is a mess</em></li>
</ul>


<p> <em>-Martin Fowler, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html">Flaccid Scrum</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>If you are looking up to Scrum to solve the problems with the quality of code you are delivering, you are with the wrong process. Scrum does not talk anything specific about software development and related practices. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">Extreme Programming</a> is one process that is specific to coding and software development and is also a type of agile software development. It talks about the various development practices lays down strict rules <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">related to software development</a>. Again if you decide to follow this do that religiously - Sticking to the Process matters. Picking up only certain aspects of different school of thoughts might not provide the desired output always. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/is-code-coverage-a-lie/">Code Coverage</a> if one such practice that is picked up in isolation and seen to produce not much value.</p>

<p>Given these new insights, I now feel that following a proven process framework, like Scrum will help a team achieve its goals. The core values that Scrum lays down is important for any team. From my personal experience, the reason why I used to look down upon Scrum is that it was not practiced the way it was laid out. Like in software development premature optimization of the process is likely to give less value. The training provided a lot of new insights and helped me to have a better understanding of the Scrum process framework. I did the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-certifications/professional-scrum-master-i-assessment">PSM I</a> and <a href="https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-certifications/professional-scrum-product-owner-i-assessment">PSPO I</a> (I had attended this training last year but never took the test until now) assessment and got certified.  Are you using Scrum, what are your experiences?</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>While working on large codebases, I want my Solution Explorer to be synchronized with the current working file. With the solution explorer in sync, it makes navigating to other related files, adding new classes in the same location, renaming files, etc. faster.</p>

<p><img alt="Track Active Item in Solution Explorer, Visual Studio" src="/images/visualstudio_trackActiveItem.png" /></p>

<p>The setting to keep the items in sync is configurable in Visual Studio and is turned off by default. You can enable this by checking the &lsquo;<strong><em>Track Active Item in Solution Explorer</em></strong>&rsquo; under <em>Options -> Projects and Solutions -> General</em>. You can navigate there quickly using <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/quick-launch-in-visual-studio/">Visual Studio Quick Launch (Ctrl + Q)</a>. Just type &lsquo;<em>Track active</em>&rsquo; and you will get the quick link to the setting. Keep it checked, and off you go, the solution explorer and the current file will be in sync.</p>

<p>PS: Visual Studio 2017 is now available.<a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/">Get it</a> if you have not already!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Populating data for tests is the section of the test that usually ends up making tests more coupled with the code that it is testing. Coupling makes tests more fragile and refactoring code harder because of breaking tests. We should try to avoid coupling with the implementation details when writing tests. Let us see a few options that we have to populate test data and constructing object graphs (chain of objects branched off from the root object). I use <a href="https://xunit.github.io/">xUnit.net</a> as my test framework, but you can use these techniques in your choice of framework.</p>

<p><a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Data-Driven%20Test.html" class="center" title="Image from xUnit Test Patterns"><img class="center" alt="Populating Test Data" src="/images\test_data.gif" /></a></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some simple tests on a Customer class shown below.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">string</span> <span class="n">FullName</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="k">get</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">FirstName</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="s">&quot; &quot;</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="n">LastName</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&rsquo;s say we need to test that the FullName property returns as expected. We will use a <em>Theory</em> type tests for testing different combinations of first and last name. xUnit.net includes support for two different major types of unit tests: facts and theories</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Facts are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.</em></p>

<p><em>Theories are tests which are only true for a particular set of data.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Theories allow us to create parameterized tests with which we can run a given test with different parameter options. Like in this example we need to test the Customer class with different set of First and Last Name combinations. As you can see below the test is attributed with Theory Attribute, and we use the InlineData attribute to pass static values to the test. Using these parameters we are now able to test for different combinations of first and last names. The test populates only the required properties on Customer object for testing FullName.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Tests help refine the public API as they are the first consumers</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The tests above acts as a clue indicating that the three properties - FirstName, LastName, FullName are related and go hand-in-hand. These tests are a strong indication that these properties can be grouped together into a class and possibly tested separately. We can extract these properties into a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/thinking-beyond-primitive-values-value-objects/">Value Object</a> for e.g. Name. I will not go into the implementation details of that, and I hope you can do that you own.</p>

<p>The above tests still have a high dependency on the code that it is testing - <strong><em>the constructor</em></strong>. Imagine if we had a lot of such tests that constructs the Consumer class inline in the setup phase. All tests will break if the class constructor changes. We saw in the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/refactoring-test-code-removing-constructor-dependency/">refactoring to remove constructor dependency</a> how to remove such dependencies and make the tests independent of the constructor dependencies.  We can introduce Object Mother or Test Data Builder pattern as mentioned in the article. Optimizing further we can also use <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture">AutoFixture</a> to generate test data. Moving into these patterns or AutoFixture brings in an added benefit as well; the rest of properties on the Customer class also gets populated by default.</p>

<h3>Explicitly Setting Properties</h3>

<p>By introducing AutoFixture, we no longer need to create the Customer object explicitly. We can use the Fixture class generate a Customer class for us. Using AutoFixture, this can be achieved in at least two ways (I am not sure if there are more ways of doing this).</p>

<p>In both cases, we explicitly set the required properties. The above test is similar to the previous test that we wrote without AutoFixture. But no longer are we dependent on the constructor. In the second way of using AutoFixture I used <em>InlineAutoData</em> attribute, that is part of <em>Ploeh.AutoFixture.Xunit2</em>. This attribute automatically does the fixture initialization and injects the Customer object for us. For all the values that it can match from the inline parameter list, it uses the provided values. It starts generating random values once all the parameters passed inline are used. In this case, only Customer object is created by AutoFixture.</p>

<h3>AutoFixture and Immutable types</h3>

<p>When using immutable types or properties with private setters, we cannot set the property value after it is created.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>AutoFixture was originally build as a tool for Test-Driven Development (TDD), and TDD is all about feedback. In the spirit of GOOS, you should listen to your tests. If the tests are hard to write, you should consider your API design. AutoFixture tends to amplify that sort of feedback.</em></p>

<p>-<em><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/20816487/1948745">Mark Seemann</a> (creator of AutoFixture)</em></p></blockquote>

<p>In these cases, the suggested approach is something closer to the manual <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test Data Builder</a> we saw in the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/refactoring-test-code-removing-constructor-dependency/">refactoring example</a>. We can either have an explicit test data builder class or define extension methods on the immutable type such that it changes just the specified property and returns all other values same, as shown below.</p>

<p>As shown the <em>WithFirstName</em> method returns a new Name class with just the first name changed. Again we do not need these <em>WithXXX</em> methods for all the properties. Only when there is a need to change any of the property values as part of the requirement do we need to introduce such methods and even test it. This again drives to the above point of using tests to guide the API design, from the feedback.</p>

<h3>Customization</h3>

<p>In cases where we have validations in constructor to hold the class constraints, we cannot rely on the random values generated by AutoFixture. For example.
- The string should be at least ten characters in length for a Name class
- Start date should be less than the End date for a date range class</p>

<p>Without any custom code if we are to rely on AutoFixture to generate us, such classes, the tests will not be predictable. Depending on the random value that AutoFixture generates it might create a valid instance or throw an exception. To make this consistent, we can add Customization to ensure predictability.</p>

<p>For the DateRange class below we can add the following Customization.</p>

<p>The customization gets invoked every time a DateRange object is requested using the fixture. It then invokes this custom code that we have added in and creates a valid DateRange object. For the tests use the customization as part of the fixture either using a custom data attribute or explicitly adding the customization into the Fixture class.</p>

<h3>Mocking behavior</h3>

<p><a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Mock%20Object.html">Mock Objects</a> is a popular way to unit test classes in isolation. For the external dependencies that a <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/SUT.html">System Under Test</a> (SUT) has, the dependencies are mocked using a mocking framework. In these cases, we can setup the external dependencies to return different values as we expect for different tests and test the logic of the SUT and how it responds. Such tests are usually more coupled with the implementation as we have to setup the mocks prior. So we need to have an understanding of the return values expected from dependencies and the parameters expected by the dependencies. I use Moq framework for mocking, and AutoFixture has a library that helps integrate well with it.</p>

<p>The tests above uses <a href="http://blog.nikosbaxevanis.com/2012/07/31/autofixture-xunit-net-and-auto-mocking/">InlineAutoMoqData attribute</a> which is a customized xUnit data attribute that uses Moq framework to inject dependencies. The Mock<ICustomerRepository> represents a mocked interface implementation. Behavior is setup on the mock using the Setup method. By using <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/03/17/AutoFixtureFreeze/">Frozen</a> attribute for the Mock parameter, we tell AutoFixture to create only one instance of the mocked object and then use the same instance for any future requests of that type. This forces the same instance of the repository to be injected into the CustomerController class as well when it asks for a ICustomerRepository to AutoFixture.</p>

<p>Creating test data is an important aspect of any test. Making sure that you minimize the dependencies on the implementation detail is important to make your tests more robust. This allows the code to be refactored as long as some of the core contracts that we are testing remain the same. AutoFixture helps minimize the code in <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Four%20Phase%20Test.html">Fixture Setup phase</a>, which otherwise tends to grow bigger. Hope this helps you with your tests!</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><img class="center" alt="Azure Powershell Get-AzureRmContext" src="/images/powershell_azurermcontext.png" /></p>

<p>When accessing Key Vault using Powershell it can be a bit tricky when you have multiple subscriptions under the same account. The Key Vault cmdlets being under the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">Resource Manager (RM) mode</a> depends on the current RM Subscription. The Key Vault cmdlets enable you to manage only the key vaults under the selected subscription. To access the key vaults in other subscriptions, you need to switch the selected RM subscription.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Use <strong>Select-AzureRmSubscription</strong> to switch the selected RM subscription</em></p></blockquote>

<p> The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.profile/v2.2.0/get-azurermcontext">Get-AzureRmContext</a> returns the metadata used for RM requests. The SubscriptionId/SubscriptionName property indicates the selected subscription. Any Key Vault cmdlets (or RM cmdlets) will work based off that selected subscription. To change the selected Azure RM subscription use the Select-AzureRmSubscription cmdlet. Pass in the SubscriptionId or the Subscription Name that you wish to switch to and the RM Subscription will be set to that. To get the SubscriptionId/SubscriptionName of the subscriptions under your account use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn495302.aspx">Get-AzureSubscription</a> cmdlet.</p>

<pre><code class="` powershell"> Get-AzureRmContext
 Get-AzureRmSubscription
 Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName  "Your Subscription Name"
 Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId  a5287dad-d5a2-4060-81bc-4a06c7087e72
</code></pre>

<p> I struggled with this for some time, so hope it helps you!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><a href="http://perspecsys.com/" class="center" title="Image By Perspecsys Photos, from https://www.flickr.com/photos/111692634@N04/15855489588"><img class="center" alt="Security" src="/images\pfx_security.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>In one of my earlier posts, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/pfx-certificate-in-azure-key-vault/">PFX Certificate in Azure Key Vault</a>, we saw how to save PFX Certificate files in Key Vault as Secrets. Azure Key Vault now <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/kv/2016/09/26/get-started-with-azure-key-vault-certificates/">supports certificates as a first class citizen</a>. This means one can manage certificates as a separate entity in KeyVault. At the time of writing, Key Vault supports managing certificates using Powershell. The <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/managing-key-vault-through-azure-portal/">portal UI</a> is still to catch up on this feature. Using the Key Vault&rsquo;s certificate feature, we can create a new certificate: self-signed or signed by a supported certificate authority, import an existing certificate, retrieve the certificate with or without a private key part.</p>

<h3>Setting up the Vault</h3>

<p>With the introduction of the certificates feature, a new command line switch is added to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.keyvault/v2.2.0/set-azurermkeyvaultaccesspolicy">Set-AzureRmKeyVaultAccessPolicy</a> cmdlet <em><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.keyvault/v2.2.0/set-azurermkeyvaultaccesspolicy#PermissionsToCertificates">-PermissionToCertificates</a></em>. It supports the following values - <em>all, get, create, delete, import, list, update, deleteissuers, getissuers, listissuers, setissuers, managecontacts</em>. For a key vault created after the introduction of this feature, the property is set to <em>all</em> for the creator&rsquo;s access policy. For any vault created before the introduction of the feature, this property needs to be explicitly set to start using it.</p>

<h3>Create Certificate</h3>

<p>To create a new certificate in the vault use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.keyvault/v2.2.0/add-azurekeyvaultcertificate">Add-AzureKeyVaultCertificate</a> cmdlet. The cmdlet requires a Certificate Policy that specifies the subject name, issuer name, validity, etc.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$certificatepolicy</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nb">New-AzureKeyVaultCertificatePolicy</span>   <span class="n">-SubjectName</span> <span class="s2">&quot;CN=www.rahulpnath.com&quot;</span>   <span class="n">-IssuerName</span> <span class="n">Self</span>   <span class="n">-ValidityInMonths</span> <span class="n">12</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">Add-AzureKeyVaultCertificate</span> <span class="n">-VaultName</span> <span class="s2">&quot;VaultFromCode&quot;</span> <span class="n">-Name</span> <span class="s2">&quot;TestCertificate&quot;</span> <span class="n">-CertificatePolicy</span> <span class="nv">$certificatepolicy</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Executing the above creates a certificate in the vault with the given name. To retrieve the certificates in the key vault use the. The certificate object identifier is similar to that of Keys and Secrets as shown below. This identifier is used to identify a certificate uniquely.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>https://vaultfromcode.vault.azure.net:443/certificates/TestCertificate
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To retrieve all the certificates in a vault use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.keyvault/v2.2.0/get-azurekeyvaultcertificate">Get-AzureKeyVaultCertificate</a> cmdlet passing in the VaultName. To get details of a certificate pass in the Certificate Name as well.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Azure Key Vault, GetAzureKeyVaultCertificate" src="/images\keyvault_getazurekeyvaultcertificate.png" /></p>

<p>When creating a new certificate make sure that a Key or Secret does not exist with the same name in the vault. Azure adds in a key and secret with the same name as that of the certificate when creating a new certificate as shown in the above image. The key is required when for certificates created with non-exportable key (-<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.keyvault/v2.1.0/new-azurekeyvaultcertificatepolicy#KeyNotExportable">KeyNotExportable</a>). Non-exportable certificates do not have the private portion contained in secret. Any certificate operation requiring the private part should use the key. For consistency, the key exists for exportable certificates as well.</p>

<p>To import an existing certificate into the key vault, we can use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.keyvault/v2.1.0/import-azurekeyvaultcertificate">Import-AzureKeyVaultCertificate</a> cmdlet. The certificate file should be either PFX or PEM format.</p>

<h3>Recreate Certificate Locally from Key Vault</h3>

<p>Often we will have to recreate the certificate on the machine where the application using it is running. To create the private portion of the certificate retrieve it from the Secret, load it into a certificate collection, export and save the file locally.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>If you are the kind of person who wants to manage a list of tasks and like checking it off and moving towards a goal then this post is for you. I am a fan of the <a href="http://amzn.to/2gsJaed">Getting Things Done</a> methodology by David Allen and found the book and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=david+allen">videos</a> mind blowing. Ever since reading the book for the first time I had been searching for a tool that helps to follow the GTD process. Though the GTD process in itself is not tied to a particular tool and works well with pen and paper, I am more towards a digital medium, as that&rsquo;s where I spent most of my time. I have tried a lot of different tools, almost everything that came up when searching for to do lists.</p>

<p>Some of the key features that I was looking out of a to-do list application are</p>

<ul>
<li>Quickly Capture tasks from anywhere</li>
<li>Availability on multiple devices</li>
<li>Able to group and categorize tasks</li>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Assign date time and set reminders</li>
<li>Simplistic and easy user interface</li>
</ul>


<p><img alt="Todoist" src="/images/todoist.png" /></p>

<p><a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> is one platform that I found the best matching with my needs and have been with it for over two years. It started with a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-organized-finding-a-system-to-manage-it-all/#comment-1528539219">comment by my friend on one of my posts</a>. Since then I am using Todoist. After trying for a couple of weeks, I quickly moved on to their <a href="https://todoist.com/premium">premium version</a> for the various features that it provides. Todoist has a clean and minimalistic interface and never stays in the way of getting things done. Be it the mobile app, the desktop app or the Chrome plugin; it enables easy task management. Any new task added by default goes into the Inbox which can be categorized and processed later. This processing flow fits with the process outlined in GTD. Tasks can be assigned labels and categories, set priorities, set for action on a specific date. Tasks added to one app is synced across all the apps seamlessly., enabling a smooth and consistent experience across.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Getting Things Done is tool agnostic. Tools do not matter; it is about the process. Choose any tool that works for you, for me it&rsquo;s Todoist</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Todoist had all the features that I was looking out for in a task management application. Give Todoist a try if you are looking out for a task management application. Irrespective of the tools that you use it is your ability to stick to a plan and focus on tasks that will help you reach your goal.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>With the Australia Day (and Indian Republic Day) falling on a Thursday I got a long weekend by taking the Friday off. Me, Parvathy (my wife) and Gautham (my son) decided to head off to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Tb4awz6cx6H2">Coffs Harbour</a>, which is a six-hour drive from Sydney. We started off at six, Thursday morning.</p>

<p>This was the first time Parvathy, and I was doing a road trip this long with Gautham and had no idea what to expect. Gautham was wide awake from the start of the trip till we reached Coffs Harbour. But it was all right traveling with him. The trip was also the first since he was fully toilet-trained. We did stop at 3 places on the way but were happy to do that. We stopped for breakfast at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/H72Loz9zofk">Hungry Jack&rsquo;s, Beresfield</a> and had quick burger, fries and hash brown. We continued to have this same breakfast throughout the trip, for it was fast and enabled to get on with the day quickly. Deciding, ordering and eating at a cafe is much more time-consuming. After two more stops, we reached Coffs Harbour by two in the noon. Since both me and Parvathy are trying to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/">eat healthy (since a month)</a>, we decided to keep our lunch light. Mostly we had carrots, cucumber, and some nuts. For Gautham, we usually got something on the way.</p>

<h3>Day1 (Thursday)</h3>

<p>We headed straight to Royal Palms Motor Inn and dropped our bags and quickly freshened up. The weather forecast said it would rain, but luckily there was no rain and was a pleasant climate. We headed off straight to Jetty Beach, where we spent the rest of our day. The beach was calm and had a great walk by the side of it. The sand looked like a mirror, and in the beginning, Gautham was even cautious not to break it. We enjoyed the time there and stayed there till five. After having a wash down at the beach showers, we headed back to the hotel. Gautham fell asleep the moment we got into the car. We reached the hotel and stayed in the car till seven so not to disturb his sleep. Once he woke up, we headed off to Bombay Brasserie, an Indian restaurant right next to the hotel. We usually prefer other food option while eating outside to try different cuisine. But during the trip, we stuck to Indian hotels as Gautham often ends up eating more from there, as it was similar to food at home. We had a nice tandoori platter, Nan, rice and ice-cream. By half past eight, we reached back at the hotel, had a bath and went to sleep by ten.</p>

<h3>Day 2 (Friday)</h3>

<p>We all slept in a bit late today and woke up by seven. Luckily Parvathy was up and ready by then. After a quick fresh up, we started off to Dorrigo. Picked up our breakfast burgers on the way and headed off straight to Dorrigo. It was just over an hours drive from the hotel and a scenic one too. Dorrigo has a <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions?&amp;">lot of attractions</a>, but we just did the <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions/skywalk-lookout">Skywalk Lookout</a>, <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions/wonga-walk">Wonga Walk</a>, <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions/walk-the-birds-boardwalk">Walk with The Birds Boardwalk</a> and <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions/dangar-falls">Dangar Falls</a>. We spent half a day there covering all these. The lookout and the walks were superb. It was a pleasant walk in the forest as it had rained the night before. By the time we headed back, Gautham was fast asleep after having a delicious cake with cream and juice. Woolgoolga was the next stop and was around one and half hours away. By three in the evening, we hit the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1fBYqWHDnyC2">beach</a>. By five we headed back to the hotel. On the way, we drove through <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Pm7jh9nJRCM2">Emerald beach</a> to the hotel. After a quick fresh up we set out for dinner by six. We tried a different Indian restaurant today and ate to our full. By ten we hit the bed.</p>

<h3>Day 3 (Saturday)</h3>

<p>I woke up at half past five and went for a run. I <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/users/4b76cfab-734e-1658-b5e4-600759a3b066/sport-sessions/588ba8d079a46318f38e5d10">ran by the boat jetty to jetty beach and through the Coffs Coast State Park</a>. The route was scenic, and I enjoyed it.By seven I was at the hotel and got ready to checkout. We checked out by eight, grabbed a <a href="http://www.boostjuice.com.au/products">Boost smoothie</a> and burger and headed off to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/P9e9sx5eib62">Sawtell beach</a>. It was a hot day, and the sun was already up and high. We just had a quick walk by the beach side and headed straight to <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/nambucca-heads">Nambucca heads</a> as we wanted to spend more time there. The walk by the Nambucca river is excellent. You can see the river meeting the sea here, and it is a beautiful sight. The river is calm and up to waist height and we can easily walk. We spent around two hours there and started our way back home at around one in the noon. It is around six hours drive, and with a couple of stops along the way, we reached home by eight in the evening.</p>

<p><img alt="Nambucca Heads, Coffs Harbour" src="/images/coffs_harbour_nambucca_heads.jpg" /></p>

<p>It was a good three-day break and completely disconnected from work and social media. It was refreshing, and the drive was great too. This was our first long drive after coming to Sydney and enjoyed it.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/screenshots-with-snagit/" itemprop="url">Tip of the Week: Screenshots with Snagit</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I have been using <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html">Snagit</a> for over one and half years and been loving it. Snagit gives you a way to create and edit screenshots or record videos to show a process, provide detailed feedback, or share information with the people who need it most. It tucks away neatly to the side of your screen and is there up and ready when you want to grab a screen capture or record a quick video. The screen capture is easily triggered using keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + Alt + S by default). Once captured, it takes you to the Snagit editor where you can add a lot more details to the captured image.</p>

<p><img alt="Snagit" class="center" src="/images/snagit.gif" /></p>

<p>Some of the  features that I often use are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blur (or Redact)</strong>: Use to hide or disguise sensitive information. Often my screenshots contain sensitive content which I want to blur.</li>
<li><strong>Step</strong>: Add a series of numbers or letters to label steps or items in a capture. This feature helps in guiding a step by step process in a screenshot.</li>
<li><strong>Crop</strong>: Common feature in all image editors.</li>
<li><strong>Spotlight &amp; Magnify</strong>: Magnify, blur or dim a selected area of the picture. This feature is useful to highlight specific parts of the image.</li>
<li><strong>Callouts, Text, and Arrows</strong>: Again pretty much standard with most image editors.</li>
</ul>


<p>Snagit has been a great fit for blogging and makes creating screenshots easy. Communicating with images is much faster with these great features. If you take a lot of screenshots give <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/download/snagit/">Snagit a try</a>, you will love it!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Often when coding, I need to move pieces of code up or down. It could be a group of lines of code or an entire function that I need to shift up or down. In earlier versions of Visual Studio, I had to select the lines of code, cut them from current place, move the cursor to the desired position and paste it. That&rsquo;s a lot of keystrokes for getting a simple thing done. In the latest versions of Visual Studio (I am currently on VS2015) we can use  <strong>Alt + Up/Down</strong> to move the selection up or down. This also works for the current line without selecting it.</p>

<p><img alt="Defensive Coding" src="/images/visualstudio_moveselectedlines.gif" /></p>

<p>Hope this helps to move code around faster!</p>
