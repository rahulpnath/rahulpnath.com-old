  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><blockquote><p>TypeScript is  superset of JavaScript and compiles to clean JavaScript output.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> has been around for some time and is gaining more traction these days with more and more projects embracing it. The latest addition to the list <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a>, which is a very popular JavaScript framework. TypeScript brings in more structure to the way JavaScript is written and maintained. Being a compiled language, errors will be found as the code is written and not waiting till run time. Ease of refactoring and rich tooling support makes TypeScript a perfect choice for large-scale projects. TypeScript also provides improved code readability and organizing capabilities. The official documentation is a good starting point to get started with TypeScript and get some hands-on experience using <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground">Playground</a>, which shows the compiled JavaScript real-time in browser. If you are like me, who would prefer a similar experience, but in you favourite editor then this post explains how to set up the environment for playing around with TypeScript and seeing the real-time compiled JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Create folder</strong> To start with lets first create a folder to work in. In this example I would be using npm(Node Package Manager) to get all the required packages. If you are new to Node, then head off to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a> to get started and install the runtime before continuing on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>npm init</strong> Once done with the node setup, run the <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init">init</a> command, within the project folder (created above), to initialize the node project. This prompts a series of questions and creates a <em>package.json</em> file with the entered options.</p></li>
<li><strong>npm install -g typescript</strong> If you already have TypeScript installed (which comes in default with Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 onwards) then you can skip this step. If not, run &lsquo;npm install -g typescript&rsquo;, which will install it into the global scope.</li>
<li><strong>Hello World from TypeScript</strong> With the compiler setup, we are good to write out first hello world, for which we create a file with .ts extension.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">){</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello World &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;TypeScript&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To compile this manually we need to run the TypeScript compiler (which we installed in the previous step). The below command will compile the TypeScript file into JavaScript and output into the same folder.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>tsc HelloWorld.ts
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;TypeScript&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><strong>Automating the compilation</strong> To prevent running the above step every time we make a change to the typescript file, we can automate the build step. The tsc has a compiler switch to watch the file for changes and automatically compile every time a change happens. For this run the above command with a &lsquo;<em>&ndash;watch</em>&rsquo; command.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>tsc HelloWorld.ts --watch
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>
<img class="center" alt="Visual Studio Code Coverage" src="/images/tsc_options.png" /></p>

<p>The watch switch is only available in the later versions of the compiler. To check whether your version supports it, run tsc alone which will show all the supported commands. If you do not see the watch switch as shown above, you will need to update the TypeScript compiler version. For this check the environment variables to see the path to your current compiler. If this has a path to an older version (possibly to one that Visual Studio installed at <em>Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\TypeScript</em>), then remove it. Now do a fresh install using npm, to install the latest version.</p>

<p>Open up both the TypeScript file and the generated JavaScript file in your favorite editor and you will see real-time updates to the JavaScript code, when you update the TypeScript code.<br/>

<p>Hope this helps you with setting up the development environment to learn TypeScript!</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><blockquote><p>Please check <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">here</a> for scripts using the latest PowerShell cmdlets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Granting access to different users to manage the key vault would be a typical scenario in an organization. This could either be to create new vaults or manage keys and secrets within an existing key vault. One way to do that would be to create an <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">AD application and use that to manage the vault</a>. Alternatively you would also want to add users to your azure subscription and grant them access for this (which was exactly what one of my readers wanted to achieve and reached out to me for).</p>

<p>In this post we will see how we can add a new user and grant him the required permissions. The permissions to be provided would differ based on your requirement, so you would want to modify them as required.</p>

<h4><strong>Creating the user</strong></h4>

<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-create-users/">Creating a new user to the azure subscription</a> can easily be done from the <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com">management portal</a>. We need to create the user in the azure subscription, as any resource in the subscription can be accessed only after authenticating against the Active Directory (AD) associated with it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Every Azure subscription is associated with an Azure Active Directory (AD) and needs to be authenticated with, before any of its resources can be used.</p></blockquote>

<p>Azure Key Vault gets created in the default AD associated with the subscription, so we need to add the new user to that. (If you are not sure on how to find the default AD <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">this post</a> describes it in the beginning). In the portal under the <em>Azure Directory</em> option, select the default directory and on the <em>Users</em> tab, we can add a new user.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ad_add_user.png" class="center"></img></p>

<p>When creating the user, you can <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-assign-admin-roles/">assign the role required</a> based on the requirement. In this case I have added the user to a &lsquo;<em>User</em>&rsquo; role, as I do not want this user to have any administrative access to the my azure subscriptions or resources.</p>

<h4><strong>Creating the key vault</strong></h4>

<p>To create a key vault that we want to give permissions for the user, the below powershell scripts can be used. If you are new to key vault, then check out the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Getting Started with Azure  Key Vault</a> or <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/azure-key-vault/">other related articles</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The above scripts creates the key vault under the &lsquo;<em>SharedGroup</em>&rsquo;. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/#resource-groups">Resource Groups</a> are logical containers, used to group resources together as required. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/role-based-access-control-configure/">Access to azure resources</a> can be assigned at any of the three levels (subscription, resource group or resource) and it inherits down the hierarchy as shown below. Roles can be assigned specifically to a resource, or to resource group (which would mean all to all resources in that group) or at the subscription level (which would apply to all resources/resource groups in that subscription.).</p>

<p><a href="https://acomdpsstorage.blob.core.windows.net/dpsmedia-prod/azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/role-based-access-control-configure/20151006095042/rbacassignmentscopes.png"><img src="/images/rbac_assignment_scopes.png" class="center"></img></a></p>

<h4><strong>Setting Permission on the resource group</strong></h4>

<p>As an administrator I want the newly created user to have permission to interact with the key vault, but not create new or delete existing vaults. I would also want to give the user ability to modify keys and secrets within the vault. Currently since the new user does not have any rights, we should first give him rights to see the vaults in the <em>SharedGroup</em>. For this a <em>Reader</em> role from the set of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/role-based-access-control-configure/#built-in-roles">built in roles</a> can be assinged, through the new azure portal or powershell.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><img src="/images/resource_group_permission.png" class="center"></img></p>

<p>To modify objects (keys/secrets) in the key vault we need to run <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn903607.aspx">Set-AzureKeyVaultAccessPolicy</a> cmdlet with the required permissions, to grant access for the user. In the below script the user is given all Permissions to both keys and secrets, and this again depends on your requirement.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4><strong>Creating the key (new user)</strong></h4>

<p>The new user can login with the email id and password, shared to him by the administrator (received when creating the user in the AD), in the powershell prompt and create keys/secrets in the key vault.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The newly created user now has full access on the key vault and only that. He can only add/remove objects within the key vault and see resources within the SharedGroup. This way the administrator can be rest assured that no other sensitive information or accesses is being shared accidentally. Periodically revisiting these permissions and revoking unnecessary accesses is recommended!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Tools are an indispensable part of our daily life and we all have our own likes and dislikes for them. Here are a list that I use (almost daily), most of them influenced from the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/tools">greater list</a>. Having a great keyboard support is something that I look out for, especially for those that I interact with more frequently (IDE&rsquo;s or code editors). Couple of days back, while having a chat with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/zpbappi">Bappi</a> some of these came up and he found a few interesting, so though of sharing the list over here.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio</a></strong>: This one is almost daily and is one of them that gets on along with my laptop. For a Microsoft stack developer I do not think there are much alternatives(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/">WebMatrix</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>) if you are looking for full fledged development. Personally I am on VS2015 now(since I am lucky enough to have a free MSDN subscription), but being on any of the version is equally good.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://www.onenote.com/">One Note</a></strong>: For note taking I prefer OneNote as it is easy to manage and organize and is available on all platforms. Collaborating with multiple users is also so easy and comes loaded with features making it suitable for all kinds of scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-in/">OneDrive</a>/<a href="https://db.tt/bvYw3pL6">Dropbox</a></strong>: I use a mix of OneDrive and Dropbox for backing up my data and photos and find the experience for both good on all devices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://cmder.net/">Cmder</a></strong>: Looking out for a cool console in Windows, then this is the one! Loads of features and awesome color scheme makes it really one of the best consoles. Ctrl + C for copy and Ctrl + V works nicely on this(and you do not need to be on Windows 10 for this) and that alone would drive me to try out this one.</p></li>
<li><p><strike><strong><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></strong>: As the tag-line says, this is &lsquo;<em>The text editor that you would fall in love with</em>&rsquo;. I use this primarily for all my writing (except for markdown formats, for which I use <a href="http://markdownpad.com/">MarkdownPad</a>), quick edits, formatting and even for some coding when I do not want the full power of Visual Studio. There are loads of plugins available and a good community of users backing it.</strike>
<strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a></strong>: The experience on VS Code has dramatically improved from the day that I originally wrote the post. Code is now my one stop editor and I use it for my blogging too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a></strong>: I have tried out a lot of tools and finally ended up with the premium version of Todoist for task management. Its got everything right and highly flexible to organize your tasks and has full fledged apps on all platforms, browsers and even mail integration. Its almost easy to access Todoist from any context that I am working on and syncs across all devices seamlessly. Its really worth paying for this one, if not you could use the free version with some reduced features.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">AHK</a></strong>: This tiny little tool has innumerous uses and capabilities, but I just use very few of it to automate certain mundane tasks, store a list of <a href="http://ahkscript.org/docs/Hotstrings.htm">hotstring</a> and application <a href="http://ahkscript.org/docs/Hotkeys.htm">shortcut keys</a>. I have all my scripts synced across multiple PC&rsquo;s and have added a task in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/schedule-task#1TC=windows-7">Task Scheduler</a> to run the scripts with highest privileges every time I log on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a></strong>: It&rsquo;s a password manager and is available on all platforms and quite easy to get started with. I had been using the browser capabilities to store and sync passwords before which was working fine. But password managers solve a totally different problem of generating passwords (though they also sync generated passwords without which it would be more difficult to use them given that we have multiple devices these days) as a <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/03/only-secure-password-is-one-you-cant.html">secure password is one that you cannon remember</a>. 1Password has a one time fee for license, can shared by up to six family members living in the same household, has various synchronization options and mainly gives you the control where all the data is stored.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.noisli.com/">Noisli</a>,<a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a></strong>: Like to here music or have some background noise then these are for you. Noisli is a background noise generator, and lets you create different different combinations for your taste. SoundCloud has a lot of music tracks in them and it is free for online streaming.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a></strong>: The free web debugging proxy for any browser, system or platform, this one is really an indispensable tool if you are doing any kind of web development.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>,<a href="https://getpocket.com/a/">Pocket</a></strong>: Feedly is an RSS reader and has got quite a good UI and syncs across all devices and helps me keep all the reading list in one place. If you want to have some articles to read while offline then Pocket is for you. Pocket downloads the article while online onto devices and keeps it available for reading. I have been experimenting (for a little over a month) to go offline on mobile and use this for my offline reading if I don&rsquo;t have the Kindle.(The experiment is going pretty good if not for a very few times I had to turn connectivity on for finding bus routes and timings.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</a></strong>: Really its &lsquo;beyond&rsquo; just comparing files and is really useful for comparing and merging files. I use the pro version and really recommend it. Integrates nicely with Visual Studio and other IDE&rsquo;s and also provides context menu&rsquo;s on file explorer.</p></li>
<li><p><del>Resharper</del>: I had been using this on and off and realized that mostly I was using only the &lsquo;navigate to&rsquo; feature and decided on to start using the in built features of Visual Studio. <a href="https://twitter.com/ploeh">Mark Seemann</a> has quite an interesting <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/02/04/BewareofProductivityTools/">article</a> on this and I couldn&rsquo;t agree any more. Resharper is also changing their licensing model going from a one time fee to a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/">monthly fee</a>, which I don&rsquo;t personally prefer especially for a tool like R#.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>While there are some more, this is what I use most of the time. What tools help you at work. Do you have any better alternatives that I could try to replace something on this list.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><blockquote><p>Please check <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">here</a> for scripts using the latest PowerShell cmdlets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Access to the Key Vault is secured using AD application token, as we had seen in the &lsquo;<a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">Authenticating a Client Application with Azure Key Vault</a>&rsquo;. Quite often administrators require to manage the AD application created, performing activities like creating new AD applications, changing the certificate used to authenticate with the AD application, remove a certificate or even delete an application. All of these are possible using PowerShell scripts and administrators can even run this as part of their automation scripts. With the latest Azure PowerShell version(0.9.2 or higher), the Key Vault cmdlet&rsquo;s are included automatically and does not require any additional installations. For managing the Azure AD application we need to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj151815.aspx#bkmk_installmodule">install the Azure AD module for PowerShell</a> and import them into the PowerShell command prompt.</p>

<h4><strong>Creating AD application</strong></h4>

<p>The <em><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn986794.aspx">New-AzureADApplication</a></em> cmdlet is used to create a new Azure AD application. It also provides an option to specify the certificate details used to authenticate with the AD application at the time of creation itself. This can be done as a separate step if required, which is shown later in the post.</p>

<p>First we need a certificate that is to be used for authenticating against the AD application, for which I use the below commands to generate a test certificate</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>pvk2pfx -pvk mykey.pvk -spc ADTestVaultApplication.cer -pfx ADTestVaultApplication.pfx -po test
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This certificate is then used to create the AD application using the below script.</p>

<h4><strong>Removing a Certificate</strong></h4>

<p>Whenever a credential gets compromised or as part of regular credential refresh, administrators would want to remove an old certificate and replace with a new one. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn194125.aspx">Remove-MsolServicePrincipalCredential</a> cmdlet is used to remove a credential key from a service principal by specifying the key ID for the credential and the objectID/applicationID/ServicePrincipalName to identify the service principal. To get the key ID of an existing credential, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn194091.aspx">Get-MsolServicePrincipalCredential</a> cmdlet can be used, which returns the list of credentials associated with a service principal. The below script just removes the first credential, you could loop through and remove all.</p>

<p>Managing the AD application is a very important and necessary process in the life cycle of a Key Vault, as the access to the Vault is controlled using that. Certificates securing the AD applciation should be rolled/updated frequently and application permissions should be reviewed often to make sure that all applications have only the required permissions.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>In todays world the problem&rsquo;s that are solved by technology are innumerous and it is not just a single system that the customer is looking for. They usually need multiple systems solving different problems around their core domain. But as developers, we usually get carried away by the technology aspect of it, giving lesser importance to the problem or domain itself. Whenever we have multiple systems targeting the same core domain of the customer, we see that what gets reused across these systems are the &lsquo;<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/ee658105.aspx">Crosscutting concerns</a>&rsquo; like Caching, Authentication, Logging, Exception Management etc. But is this what really should be getting shared? Are our customer trying to solve these crosscutting issues? Should it not be their core domain logics and rules and validations that get shared. The Architecture Screams Technology preventing anything else but these crosscutting concerns (which are not technology specific) the only thing that is shareable across systems.</p>

<h3>Common Traits of Technology Coupling</h3>

<p>There are a lot of traits that indicate this dependency on technology and makes a system modeled around technology stand out from the one modeled around the domain. Below are some of the things that I have figured out are very strong hints indicating a tight coupling with the technology. The earlier we identify such smells the better we are to retract and get ourselves align to the needs of the domain and not the technology.</p>

<p><strong>Solution Folders and Projects</strong></p>

<p>Take a look at your solution directory from the top level and what do you infer that it is all about. Does it have folders reflecting technology stacks like ASP.Net, Web API, WPF, Ruby, NHibernate etc or does it reflect the domain space that you are trying to solve like Shipping, Stock Management, Customer Relations? This should give the first hint on what the Architecture of your application reflects. But you could easily get tricked here as &lsquo;what you see might not be what it is&rsquo;, so lets take a step in.
Before we do you might ask, Are we not building a web-site for the customer so what is wrong in having the structure indicate that? We are building a solution that solves certain problems for our customer, it is only that it is getting delivered or accessed via a web-site. Tomorrow this might be delivered via a mobile application or a rich desktop client or even a console application so having it tightly bound to web delivery mechanism is only going to hinder us on the way forward.</p>

<p><strong>Single Large Interface Project</strong></p>

<p>Having all the interfaces used across the application to be in a single interfaces project is something that I have come across quite often and this clearly indicates that something is definitely wrong here. As mentioned in <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0131857258/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=0131857258&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21&amp;linkId=VVMXRINDZWYFRWP4">Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin">Uncle Bob</a>, Interfaces should belong to the clients and should stay close to them. If multiple clients needs to use the same interface then probably you could move them out into a common library. But all interfaces in a single project possibly means you have more of <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/HeaderInterface.html">Header Interfaces</a> and not <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/01/10/RoleInterfaceRoleHint/">Role interfaces</a> as that would primarily be specific to the clients that use them. Also watch out for the references that these projects have and whether they have any technology specific references which would possibly indicate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">leaky abstraction</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Single Large Entities Project</strong></p>

<p>Same as interfaces, this is another common thing that is quite common and might possible indicate a problem in the way a domain is modeled. In a complex domain it is highly likely that an entity is not the same everywhere and is very context specific. A customer might have a different meaning in the context of Shipping and totally different in context of Customer Relations, but having a single customer that is acts as a super set for all these contexts is a problem. Also having all the entities together probably means that enough thought has not been put into separating what parts of the system changes together and what does not. This is a clear indication of poorly modeled domain. On top of this if you are using any kind of O/RM technologies to map these to the database then it just adds on to your problems when you use a single large context to map to the database.</p>

<p><strong>No Explicit boundaries</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very likely that the application talks across difference boundaries and interacts with different systems. Some of them might be external, like a third party service and some other are internal, most commonly a database. If you see the same entities that are passed along at all these boundaries then its very likely that you have a leaky abstraction, which again would get reflected by looking at the reference folder of Entities/Interfaces project. This kind of abstractions tend to break the entire system when any of these boundaries changes, causing a  rippling effect in the code.</p>

<p><strong>Source Control Commit History</strong></p>

<p>Looking at the previous commits in your source control you can tell if your dependencies are well managed and if there are a lot of technology coupling. If you have commits that have large number of files associated especially one&rsquo;s modified then it again means that you have a lot of leaking abstractions. This leak could be a technology leak or even a function leak, where the abstractions are not well contained which causes a ripple effect when anything associated changes.</p>

<p><strong>Anemic Domain Model</strong></p>

<p>This is one of the most common and greatest indication of technology coupling and lack of proper modeling of the problem domain. Open up any of the classes in your entities project and all you see are properties with getters and setters with hardly any function in them. Object Oriented Programming brought data and functions together, but hardly do we see them together. We either have classes that act as data bags or classes that use these data classes to perform transactions over them. <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html">Anemic Domain Model </a> works fine for applications that perform basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> operations and with very less business logic in them, but as complexity grows it becomes very difficult to maintain and extend. Anemia in the entities is the biggest reason why we end up having only cross-cutting features to be shared across applications for the same domain.</p>

<h3>Onion Architecture</h3>

<p>Technology should be only seen as enablers for solving the problems and it should never get in way of the original problem. Onion Architecture or Hexagonal Architecture try to solve this problem of keeping the domain model clean and separate and have the technology dependency point into it. This enables switching out the technology specific implementations at any point and also enabling us to reuse the core domain components across various systems or hosts.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The overriding rule that makes this architecture work is <em>The Dependency Rule</em>. This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. In particular, the name of something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other named software entity.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Screaming technology is a common thing in many a projects and it is not really a big problem when the domain you are trying to solve is not that complex. But usually that is not the case and we have very complex domain logics, multiple systems targeting for different areas and highly volatile requirements. These are just some of the most common indications that I have come across that indicate a tightly coupled solution. The <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/CoffeeMaker.pdf">Mark IV Special Coffee Maker</a> problem presented by Uncle Bob in his <a href="Agile%20Principles,%20Patterns,%20and%20Practices%20in%20C#](http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0131857258/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=0131857258&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21&amp;linkId=VVMXRINDZWYFRWP4">book</a>, presents us with an interesting modeling problem, shows some most common errors, why they are errors and possible ways to tackle them. That just helps to get started to think on the right path, to tackle issues in larger domains, methodologies like <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0321125215/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=0321125215&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21&amp;linkId=F6WJ7JK5CYQOIJV6">Domain Driven Design</a> would help us to solve the actual domain problems.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of posts we have seen how to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Get Started with Azure Key Vault</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">Authenticate a Client Application with the Vault</a> and also on how the vault can be used as an <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/moving-sensitive-information-from-configuration-file-to-azure-key-vault/">alternate to the configuration file to keep sensitive information secure</a>. In this post we will explore into how a key vault can be fit into the life-cycle of an application, configuring application to use the keyvault for different deployments and also on how to manage the keys/secrets for these different deployments. Any application that uses the Key Vault to manage keys and other sensitive information, should be able to switch easily to use the vault configured for it.</p>

<h3>Configuring Client-Applications to use the Key vault</h3>

<p>Objects are uniquely identified within Azure Key Vault using a URL such that no two objects in the system, regardless of geo-location, have the same URL. The complete URL to an object is called the Object Identifier and consists of a prefix portion that identifies the Key Vault, the object type, a user provided Object Name, and an Object Version. The <em>object-name</em> is case-insensitive and immutable. When an object is first created it is given a unique version identifier and is marked as the current version of the object. Creation of a new instance with the same object name gives the new object a unique version identifier and causes it to become the current version. When querying for an object <em>object-version</em> is optional and if not provided will point to the current version of the given object-name.</p>

<blockquote>https://{keyvault-name}.vault.azure.net/{object-type}/{object-name}/{object-version}</blockquote>


<p>From a client application all we need to have is to the configuration for the key vault url, and configurations to identify key/secret name which can include the version if required. This could be saved in the application&rsquo;s configuration file as shown below.</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/appSettings&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the above configuration I assume that when these configurations are used from the code, we know that if a value is a key or secret. We could have an extended configuration or string prefix&rsquo;s (key<em> or secret</em>) to indicate this and then have the code automatically detect it too if required to decouple that, but I don&rsquo;t see it really necessary. So the application at any time would only depend on these configured values, and we can easily switch it use any vault configured with the required key/secret values.</p>

<h3>Managing the Key Vault for Multiple Deployments</h3>

<p>Now that we have decoupled the application from the Key Vault, we need to see how to configure key vaults to cater for multiple deployments. In any application development life-cycle, there would be multiple deployments at a given time for the application to cater for different roles - developers, testers and maybe a production one too. It is very likely that the connection strings and other sensitive information would be deployment specific and we would want to keep them separate. Best way to achieve this would be to create Key vault per deployment so that this separation is clearly maintained. You could check on the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/key-vault/">Key Vault Pricing</a> on how this would affect your overall cost. For each of these deployments you would need to make sure that all the required keys/secrets are added with valid values. Since this can soon end up as a repeated activity, it is best to automate this (using powershell scripts or your own application)</p>

<h3>Restricting Permissions to Key Vault</h3>

<p>We had seen how to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">authenticate a client application with a Key Vault</a> using an Active Directory (AD) application, and how to set various access policies for these application&rsquo;s. Applications should be given only the minimum set of permissions that it requires to operate on, most probably this would be only the read permissions. For <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/AzureKeyVaultExplorer">administrative application&rsquo;s</a> we would want to give all permissions so that it can modify the vault keys/secrets as required. For such a scenario it is best to have, two (or more) separate AD application&rsquo;s created and have separate permissions provided.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Multiple AD applications to access key vault with different permissions" src="/images/multiple_ad_application.PNG" /></p>

<h3>What all should be there in my configuration file?</h3>

<p>All your <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/moving-sensitive-information-from-configuration-file-to-azure-key-vault/">sensitive information should be moved out of your application configuration file</a>, and Key Vault is the one place to have them all. The application&rsquo;s configuration file should only have the azure key vault url and the AD application id and certificate identifier (thumb print) that can be used to authenticate with the AD. Yes it is advisable to use the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">certificate authentication mechanism</a> as opposed to the secret mechanism, if not you would have to put the secret in your configuration file, which would be like &lsquo;giving a thief the key to your safe&rsquo;.Additionally you could also have the key identifier mappings in the configuration file that the application can use to map to key/secret in the vault as we had seen above.</p>

<p>By doing this we have fully decoupled the application and its dependency with the vault store and have also protected all our sensitive information. This also helps in having the application to be tested with configurations appropriate to the type of deployment. Hope this helps you in developing your application against the key vault.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/is-code-coverage-a-lie/" itemprop="url">Is Code Coverage a Lie?</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Code Coverage has been one of the important things that was always there on a daily build report and a number that managers were both interested and worried about. This has been the same for all projects that I had worked on, across various organizations. Various tools support measuring coverage and can be included as part of the build reports, which essentially indicates the percentage of source code that is covered by &lsquo;unit tests&rsquo;. A higher percentage obviously indicates a better tested code and more stable one is what one would expect, as that would be the sole purpose of measuring this. But how far is this true? Is a code with higher test percentage one with lesser bugs? Does 100% indicate that it is totally bug free or is this a total wrong way of seeing that number?</p>

<h3>What is Code Coverage and How is it Measured?</h3>

<p>Code Coverage indicates the percentage of code that has been covered by at least one or more tests in your test suite. So if you have a simple function like the one shown below, which just divides two numbers and if you have one test that invokes that function, then you have a code coverage of 100%. When using Visual studio tests (as that is what I have used to depict the below one), code coverage is measured either based on blocks of code or based on lines of code.</p>

<ul>
<li><h4>Block-based statement coverage</h4>

<p>For the purposes of the tools, a block is defined as a sequence of instructions that have a single entry point and a single exit point. Exit points include branch instructions, a function call, a return instruction, or, for managed code, a throw instruction.</p></li>
<li><h4>Line-based coverage</h4>

<p>For line-based coverage, the tools identify all of the blocks that make up a line and then use this information to determine the level of coverage for the line. If all of the blocks that make up the line are covered, then the tools report that the line is covered. If no blocks in the line are covered, then the tools report that the line is not covered. If some, but not all, of the blocks in the line are covered, then the tools report that the line is partially covered.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In the below case we have both 100% as there is only one line and one block and the test covers both. So should managers be happy with this code, since it has 100% coverage? Maybe they are, but ask the developers, they definitely are not, or probably they are if at the first place they wrote the tests for the sake of the report and since the managers are happy they too are. But is this what we should strive for - definitely not!</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Visual Studio Code Coverage" src="/images/code_coverage.PNG" /></p>

<h3>Trustworthy Unit Tests</h3>

<blockquote><p>Unit tests should be like a parachute - trustworthy. You are not going to jump out from an airplane with one that you know is faulty.</p></blockquote>

<p>Having unit tests that are run once in a while or just for the build reports or when the manager is at your back, are a complete waste of time. A set of faulty tests do more harm than having none, as it might give wrong judgment of the code. From the above code you can definitely find that though the coverage is 100%, the code would simply fail when a value of 0 is passed for &lsquo;b&rsquo;, and it is highly likely that this would happen too.</p>

<blockquote><p>If unit tests are written just to meet the code coverage number on a report, then I would rather fake the report than writing the tests</p></blockquote>

<p>Unit Tests really make sense only when you write them following &lsquo;<a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd">The Three Rules of TDD</a>&rsquo; or at the very least you have tests associated with every change that you make and also you make sure that we run the entire test suite before a check-in to make sure that you have broken nothing with your changes. Only when there is such &lsquo;trustworthiness&rsquo; in the tests, does it make sense to have them in the first place and not for any number on a report.</p>

<h3>How should we really see that number on the report?</h3>

<p>Now that we have seen it is all about having trustworthy tests and not about reaching a targeted number for a report, what should we really use this Code coverage report data for?</p>

<ol>
<li>If you are less than 100% it clearly indicates that there are areas of your application that is not tested. You would really want to cross check if that is an intended miss or if there is something that is actually missing and add in some more tests to be covered better.</li>
<li>When refactoring code, you can always make sure that you don&rsquo;t go back on the coverage number that you started with, so as to ensure that you have not introduced untested code into the system.</li>
<li>When cleaning up tests a drop in the coverage number clearly indicates that you have actually removed some valid and non-redundant tests.</li>
</ol>


<p>So the next time you add in a test, think why you are doing it. Is it for the report or for the application that is getting developed. Lets all <a href="https://vimeo.com/43536488">strive to be really professional</a> in what we are doing and not just hide behind some numbers. Let the number be seen for what it is - nothing less and nothing more!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><blockquote><p>Please check <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">here</a> for scripts using the latest PowerShell cmdlets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the applications today needs to use some kind of sensitive information like a database connection-string, api secret or passwords for it to connect to external service providers. Today we see that all these information are stored in the application&rsquo;s configuration file, which poses a huge security risk. Anyone having access to this configuration file could use this information to access sensitive data posing a security risk. Having understood this risk, we would not want to keep these secrets anymore in the application but move it to a safer and secure place. With <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Azure Key Vault</a>, we can have this information encrypted and saved safely out of the application and use as required from the application.Azure Key Vault provides a feature of saving such small data, <strong>Secrets</strong>, into the vault and access them over a secure endpoint.</p>

<blockquote><p>Secrets in Azure Key Vault are octet sequences with a maximum size of 10k bytes each and can have any data stored.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are new to Azure Key Vault and yet to setup a vault, you could refer to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Getting Started with Azure Key Vault</a>, to setup the vault and the Active Directory(AD) application that is used to authenticate our application to access the keyvault. Since in this case we are going to use Secrets from the key vault, while setting the key vault access policy for the the AD application, we need to explicitly set access for the application to use the secrets. Access Policy to secrets and keys are distinct and can be set accordingly and you can choose to have different application&rsquo;s to access keys and secrets separately. In the below script I have set the same application to have access to keys and secrets, by setting  <em>PermissionsToKeys</em> and <em>PermissionsToSecrets</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="nb">Set-AzureKeyVaultAccessPolicy</span> <span class="n">-VaultName</span> <span class="s1">&#39;TestVaultRahul&#39;</span> <span class="n">-ServicePrincipalName</span> <span class="s1">&#39;d4f09821-ab30-44f3-8d57-69925489b932&#39;</span> <span class="n">-PermissionsToKeys</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="n">-PermissionsToSecrets</span> <span class="n">all</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To create a secret in the Vault, you can use the powershell script command as shown below. On successful creation of the secret the identifier to the secret is returned, which can be used by the application to obtain the Secret value.Since we have given the AD application &lsquo;<em>all</em>&rsquo; access, we could also create the secret using the api client.</p>

<p>For the application to access this secret all it needs is the SecretIdentifier and the AD credentials to authenticate with the key vault. You would want to use <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">certificate based authentication</a> to authenticate against the AD application so that only the thumbprint information needs to be there in the application&rsquo;s configuration and not the secret itself as that is again a sensitive information.</p>

<p>No longer do we need to keep these sensitive information in the applications configuration file, we can just have the Secret Identifiers configured in the application and have the application fetch is as required from the vault. By doing this we have kept the sensitive information out of reach from the application and also from the people who have access to a production environment.</p>
