  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Recently I was in a discussion with my friend/colleague on conducting a few ramp up sessions for the new hires in our team. The discussion went as below,</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Me: We should hold a few sessions to make the new guys in team more comfortable</em></p>

<p><em>Friend: It&rsquo;s too early for it. We should let them find their own way and not &lsquo;spoon-feed&rsquo; them with information.</em></p>

<p><em>Me: But we are not &lsquo;spoon-feeding&rsquo; them, we are just making their learning process faster and giving then an overview on how all the technology fits together in our world of things.</em></p>

<p><em>Friend: But &lsquo;I did not have any ramp up when I joined, and I felt it was better to have learned it on my own, though it took a lot more time.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.mindtickle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/new_employee_orientation_business_strategy_research.png" class="center" title="Image, from http://www.mindtickle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/new_employee_orientation_business_strategy_research.png"><img src="/images\rampup_plan.png" class="center" alt="Rampup Plan"></a></p>

<p>Just like there are company-wide induction/onboarding sessions, I have always felt that project specific onboarding plans are also required and help new hires be part of the team and be more productive with their day-to-day activities faster. As mentioned in this <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3029820/work-smart/infographic-the-real-ways-to-hold-on-to-new-hires/3">article</a>, <em>New hires care more about effective job training and clear guidelines, and it&rsquo;s time you provide that for them.</em> It&rsquo;s best to have a plan in place when you have someone new joining your team and you along with the team are the best people to put that plan together.</p>

<h3>Boy Scout Rule</h3>

<p>The Boy Scouts have a <a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule">rule</a> - <em>&ldquo;Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.&rdquo;</em>  New hires are like &lsquo;new camp group&rsquo; at a campground, so it&rsquo;s the duty of the &lsquo;existing team&rsquo; there to make it a good experience for them.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&lsquo;Refactor&rsquo; your experiences to make it better for the next person who is about to take on the same journey</em></p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that my friend was intentionally trying not to pass on any information, but he felt that learning on their own would be better. Even I agree with him that learning on your own is far better than &lsquo;spoon-feeding&rsquo; - but a ramp up plan is not spoon-feeding. A ramp up plan is only to speed up the learning process and to make it more comfortable for someone joining new.</p>

<h3>When to create the plan?</h3>

<p>The need for such a plan is there only when there has been enough progress made on the project, after which there is someone new joining the team. So when a new hire is scheduled to join is a good time to create the &lsquo;draft&rsquo; plan. Once the new hire has gone through it and updated back with his own experiences it could become the first version of the plan, which can then be confidently shared to anyone joining after as it has worked for at least one person.</p>

<h3>What should be there in the plan</h3>

<p><em>It depends!</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s totally up to the team to decide what should be there in the plan. Some of the things that I usually have are</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview of the project and what problem it is trying to solve</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really important that everyone on the team knows what the application is trying to solve and have a common goal to work towards. It&rsquo;s not just about the code we write but about the problem we are solving and that needs to be clearly defined. I would record a video, when this is done the first time and share it with anyone joining after that, as most of the core concepts of a project rarely change. There could be a follow-up session post watching the video, to also have a quick walk through and fill any missing gaps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduction to various technologies used in the project and how everything fits together</strong></p>

<p>Technology changes so fast these days that it is nearly impossible to stay updated with all the available options. So a walk through of the different technologies and pointers to resources that worked for you and the team will be of help. If there are any specific libraries, frameworks getting used, an introduction to those should also help.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Release cycle and Release management</strong>
Every project has its own model of delivering the end product and everyone on the team should understand this process well. Having a continuous build is becoming more common these days and helps reduce the complexity of release. An end to end walk-through of the deployment process helps understand the application better and provides exposure to all the moving parts in the system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Environment/Machine setup</strong>
Software installation is one of the biggest pain when setting up a new machine for a project, especially with having specific versions of the software. Having a documented list of all the project dependencies (hardware and software) makes setting the project environment easy. It&rsquo;s preferable to have these <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">scripted</a>. Have a common place, where you can find links to all the various environments (dev, at,prod etc) and related resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patterns and Conventions</strong>
Every project has its own conventions and certain core patterns that are followed. It&rsquo;s good to have these patterns available for reference so that it helps understand the code better and helps reduce code-review cycles. Than having one big boring document, what I prefer more is to have multiple blog articles targeting each of those. I try to generalize commonly used patterns in the projects that I have worked on and create blog posts. This also helps generate content for <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/get-started-with-your-blog/">your blog</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tips &amp; Tricks</strong>
This could range from how to easily navigate the code base, scripts to do some commonly occurring task and general things to keep an eye for.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These are just some of the things I generally try to include in a ramp up plan but as said it totally depends on the team and the project.</p>

<h3>Sharing the plan</h3>

<p>Depending on the plan, if it has confidential information, you could split this into two (or more) different documents and share it at different phases of onboarding. Once a new hire is confirmed it&rsquo;s good to share the parts which do not have any confidential information. Technology stack, conventions used, machine setup (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device">BYOD</a>) are usually not confidential and can be shared well before actual employment. Once all employment agreements are in place the rest too can be shared. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to have some walk-through of the plan itself to make it easier to follow.</p>

<h3>Iterate and Improve</h3>

<p>Updating back with the experiences of the people using the plan is important to keep it current and valuable. Suggesting improvements and updates should be an item in the plan so that this does not get missed. To make updates manageable, the plan must be accessible to all and preferably version controlled if they are documents.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on having a ramp up plan?</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><em>This post helps setting up the development environment for React on VS Code using Browserify and Gulp</em></p>

<p>I have been playing around with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> for the past few days and liking the one way binding and immutability concept that it puts forward. The component-based approach and having all related code in a single place is really interesting. Need to explore more and see how it really turns out building UI&rsquo;s with React.</p>

<p>The openness of the Web makes it really difficult to get started with any development platform on it and is the same with React. There are a lot of options for getting things done and can get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue">overwhelming when newly starting out</a>. This post explains &lsquo;one way&rsquo; to set up the development environment when developing an application using the React JavaScript framework. I am using VS Code for some time now and wanted to use the same for React development. Except for setting up VS Code, everything else would still make sense to you if you are using a different editor.</p>

<h3>Package Manager for External Dependencies</h3>

<p>One of the first things we need when starting with a fresh project on React, is the React library itself. I use Node Package Manager(npm) for managing all my code and development dependencies. Use the below commands to set up the <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init">npm configuration (<em>package.json</em>) </a> and install the latest version of React library.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>npm init
</span><span class='line'>npm i --save react
</span><span class='line'>npm i --save react-dom
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<blockquote><p><em>When installing npm packages use <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#dependencies">&ndash;save</a> if it needs to be deployed with the application and use <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#devdependencies">&ndash;save-dev</a> for a package added to support development.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Setting up VS Code</h3>

<p>JavaScript development experience is better when you have <em><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript">jsconfig.json</a></em> file in your project root. VSCode recommends adding this file through a small light bulb notification on the right side of the status bar (as shown below). With this configuration file, VSCode treats all the <em>js</em> files under the same project context.</p>

<p><img class="center" src= "/images/vscode_jsconfig_balloon.png" alt="Visual Studio code jsconfig balloon notification" /></p>

<p>Intellisense for libraries is available through type definition files, usually available in the <a href="http://definitelytyped.org/">DefinitelyTyped</a> <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">repository</a>. With npm, you can manage these definition files using the <a href="https://github.com/typings/typings">TypeScript Definition Manager (typings)</a> package. To get started install the typings package and support for node packages. Now you can use <a href="https://github.com/typings/typings/blob/master/docs/commands.md">typings</a> to manage all the typescript definitions and use it for getting IntelliSense support. Once you have the correct type definitions installed for the packages you use, VSCode will show IntelliSense as shown below.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>npm i --save-dev typings
</span><span class='line'>typings install --ambient node
</span><span class='line'>typings install --save-dev gulp
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<h3>Hello World from React</h3>

<p>Now that we have enough to get us started let&rsquo;s write our first react component, which displays a message passed into it.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s save the above into <em><a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/blob/master/React_Template/src/components/helloworld.js">components/helloworld.js</a></em>. To use this component in the application, it needs to be rendered into the HTML page. So let&rsquo;s add a main entry point for the application as below and save it into <em><a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/blob/master/React_Template/src/main.js">main.js</a></em>. Notice how the component is referred in here and rendered into the HTML div element <em>app</em>.</p>

<h3>Using Browserify for Bundling</h3>

<p>Now that we have all the code needed for rendering the component, let&rsquo;s bundle up all the different JavaScript files together so that we can deploy it as a single file. Since we are using <em>JSX</em> and ES6 features, which not all browsers support, we need to transform it. <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> is a JavaScript compiler to get this done and it also has preset specific to <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/">react</a> and <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-es2015/">es2015</a>. <a href="http://browserify.org">Browserify</a> bundles all the JavaScript modules and also enables specifying transforms using the <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#usage">&ndash;transform (-t)</a> switch, to pass in <a href="https://github.com/babel/babelify">babel</a> along with the presets required.</p>

<p>If you now manually copy over the HTML file into the <em>dest</em> folder and open it from there you should be seeing the &lsquo;<em>Hello World from React</em>&rsquo; message.</p>

<h3>Automating Build and More</h3>

<p>I definitely did not want to keep running the above command and copy the HTML(/CSS) files, every time I make a change, to see the output - so automating it was very much required. What I would essentially like to have is every time I make a change on any of the files in the project, the build to trigger and output the updated application into the <em>dest</em> folder and automatically refreshing the browser so that I can see the changes (near) real-time. I chose to use <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> as this is popular and I have had some <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/organizing-tests-into-test-suites-for-visual-studio/">experience using it before</a>.</p>

<h4><strong><a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/blob/master/React_Template/gulpfile.js">gulpfile.js</a></strong></h4>

<p>To organize all the different path&rsquo;s used in the gulp build file, I have an object, <em>path</em> holding all the properties together, that&rsquo;s used in the <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md#gulptaskname--deps-fn">gulp tasks</a>. The different tasks that I have defined are to <em>build</em> ( which <em>copyHtmlFiles</em> and builds and transforms <em>js</em> files), <em><a href="https://github.com/adametry/gulp-eslint">lint</a></em>, <em><a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md#gulpwatchglob--opts-tasks-or-gulpwatchglob--opts-cb">watch</a></em>&lsquo;es the source folder for changes and triggers the required build, <em><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-connect">connect</a></em>&rsquo;s a server to host the application and automatically <em>reload</em>&rsquo;s the browser whenever code is changed.</p>

<p><img class="center" src= "/images/react_realtime_edits.gif" alt="React real-time browser refresh" /></p>

<p><em>If you find any package details missing see the <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/blob/master/React_Template/package.json">package.json</a> file.</em></p>

<p>You can find the hello world project template <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/React_Template">here</a>. The repository size is a bit high as I have <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/checking-in-package-dependencies-into-source-control/">included the npm packages</a> (<em>node_modules</em>) in the repository, which you would have anyways downloaded when doing a &lsquo;<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install">npm install</a>&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Hope this helps you to get started with React!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><em>If you have decided on <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/checking-in-package-dependencies-into-source-control/">Checking in Package Dependencies into Source Control</a> for an existing project that uses Nuget Packages then this post is for you</em></p>

<p>When using NuGet package references that are not included in the source control, these packages gets restored during build time. There are <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore">multiple ways that NuGet supports restore these dependencies at build time</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Automatic Package Restore is the current recommended approach (within Visual Studio), which is available from NuGet 2.7.</li>
<li>Command-line package restore on build servers</li>
<li>MSBuild-integrated package restore approach is the original Package Restore implementation and is still used in many projects.</li>
</ul>


<p>Depending on the type to of restore the project uses, NuGet has different configuration entries in the <em>csproj</em> files and <em>.nuget</em> folder in the solution root. So when choosing to check in package dependencies into the source control, it is a good idea to remove all these <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore/migrating-to-automatic-package-restore">generated configurations</a> and files that are not required any more. The below script does this for you!</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>WARNING!</strong> The script deletes the <em>.nuget</em> folder (if it exists), updates the <em>.csproj</em> files. Please make sure that the project folder is under source control or you have a backup of the folder. After running the script make sure that all the changes that you see are expected as explained here and the project builds and runs as before.
</div>


<p>The PowerShell script does the below for a given solution directory folder (mandatory)</p>

<ul>
<li>For each of the <em>csproj</em> file in the given folder, the script removes the

<ul>
<li><em>RestorePackages</em> node</li>
<li><em>NugetPackageImportStamp</em> node</li>
<li><em>nuget target import</em> from the solution root .nuget folder</li>
<li><em>EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports</em> node</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removes <em>.nuget</em> folder from the solution root if it exists.</li>
</ul>


<p><em>The script leaves blank lines in the </em>csproj<em> files in place of the removed nodes.</em></p>

<p>Over the past few years, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">Package Managers</a> have gained an important role in the way software gets developed. There is an <a href="https://github.com/showcases/package-managers">increasing number of package managers</a> catering to different programming languages and areas of development, making the distribution of reusable libraries and plugins easy. The convention that&rsquo;s usually followed with these package dependencies is to exclude them from source control, and use a configuration file (<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json">package.json</a>, <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore">packages.config</a>) to retrieve all the packages at build time. Even the <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">GitHub’s collection</a> of <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore">.gitignore</a> file templates ignores the packages folders of various package managers.</p>

<h3>Common Arguments for not Checking in Packages</h3>

<p>Since checking in packages is not a common practice, let&rsquo;s first see some of the arguments for not doing this and how it compares to having them checked in.</p>

<h4><strong>Storage</strong></h4>

<p><em>Packages are something that can be resolved at runtime and keeping them excluded saves that extra space on the source control system.</em></p>

<p>Yes, this might have been a good reason few years back, but these days this is not a good reason as storage has become really cheap. Moreover popular source control systems charge by the <a href="https://github.com/pricing/plans">number of repositories</a> and not by the space it occupies (although it has <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/">limits</a> on it).</p>

<h4><strong>Time</strong></h4>

<p><em>The clone is faster when you do not have packages in the source control repository as opposed to having them.</em></p>

<p>But for the project to build we need the packages restored first. So the time is either spent in the clone or in the restore. But if the packages are included in the git clone then you can immediately start working on the project after a clone and do not need any internet connectivity to make the project build. This is also of advantage if you want to run a &lsquo;<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean">git clean</a>&rsquo; - which cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control. With packages not under the source control, you have to restore them every time you run it - This is not a problem if you have internet connectivity, but will block your work if you do it when you don&rsquo;t.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Without checking in dependent packages, you can&rsquo;t git clone and get on a flight nor can you git clean while on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane_mode">flight</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover cloning a repository is a one-time activity, while a clean can be done any time a developer wants to. So it actually saves more time to keep the packages checked in.</p>

<h3>More Reason for Checking in Packages</h3>

<p>Now that we have seen most of the common arguments are not valid, let&rsquo;s see more reasons on why including the packages into the source control is actually better.</p>

<h4><strong>Explicit Dependencies</strong></h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s always better to be explicit about your code dependencies and not have them resolved by a package manager.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Packages are nothing but code and can alter the behaviour of the application.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>There are possibilities of specific package versions getting <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm">removed from the package manager</a>, which your application is still dependent on and leads to build breakage! If your package configuration is set up in such a way to resolve the latest available package of  the specific dependency, there are possibilities that the package owner pushes an update that is not backward compatible, causing the build to break! Given that these possibilities exist there is no reason to exclude package dependencies from checked in.</p>

<h4><strong>Package Source Downtime</strong></h4>

<p>Though the publicly available package sources like NuGet, npm are available almost all the time, it is likely that they too <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17806889/nuget-feed-reliability">can go down</a>. The last thing you would want is to get blocked by the downtime of these services - be it failure to build locally or on a server or even block a critical deployment. With the packages available in your source control, you have one less moving part in your whole deployment pipeline and it is better to have lesser dependencies.</p>

<h4><strong>Custom Package Sources</strong></h4>

<p>Many times I have had to update my Package sources in Visual Studio and break my head on the specific order of these entries to get the project building. This is very common when using custom packages sources like <a href="http://inedo.com/proget">ProGet</a> or <a href="https://myget.org/">MyGet</a>. Such dependencies make project setup harder and is easily avoided if all the dependent assemblies are available within the repository.  You can still have them as custom NuGet sources but have the dependencies included into the repository and update the references whenever source changes. This makes project ramp up easier and faster, with one less configuration step.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Nuget custom package source" src="/images/nuget_package_sources.png" /></p>

<p>Do you still see any reason for not checking in package dependencies into the source control? If not let&rsquo;s go and change that package folder exclude and have them included in the source. (I just updated <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/clal-command-line-application-launcher/">CLAL</a> to <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/clal/commit/736023d9ab4bd285cb077ff54acd1bbaad142a08">include dependencies.</a>)</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>It&rsquo;s been a year since using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> as my mainstream version control system and I am loving it! Before Git, I had used Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) for a very long time and was so used to it that I found Git a bit complex and overwhelming in the beginning. Team Foundation Server (TFS) is the whole product suite from Microsoft that provides source code management. Until TFS 2013, it supported only TFVC which is when it introduced <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mvpawardprogram/2013/11/13/git-for-tfs-2013/">Git in TFS</a>. Even today people use TFS and TFVC synonymously (like in the title of this post) though they are not the same.</p>

<h3>Fundamental shift in thinking</h3>

<p>By design, Git is a Distributed VCS, whereas TFS is centralized one. It takes quite a while to get your head around this and what it actually means. By definition</p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong>TFVC</strong>: Uses a single, centralized server repository to track and version files. Local changes are always checked in to the central server where other developers can get the latest changes.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Git</strong>: Git is a distributed version control system. Each developer has a copy of the source repository on their dev machine. Developers can commit each set of changes on their dev machine and perform version control operations such as history and compare without a network connection.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>You. may not see the real Distributed benefits if you are working off a central repository (hosted on a server like GitHub or Bitbucket) and using <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow">TFS way of development</a> :</p>

<p><em>Get latest code => Make your changes => Merge latest +> Check in (</em>Commit and push<em>)</em></p>

<p>The real power of Git is better understood when you start working disconnected, use branches to keep unrelated development activities separate and merge those into the main trunk (<em>master</em>) once comfortable. You get a local copy of the project and lets you make changes independent of all the other changes in the project.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Git feels so lightweight and never gets in the way of doing things.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Make command line your friend</h3>

<p>If you are a UI savvy person then Git might a good starting point to start using the command line. At first, it definitely feels hard especially if you were TFS/Visual Studio users and might be tempted to use the GUI tools available (<a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> or <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Repetitive tasks become more evident when you use a command line and easily automatable.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I use Cmder (<a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">one of my favourite tools</a>) with Git and have <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/">set up SSH</a> to Bitbucket and Github (expected soon on TFS), secured by a paraphrase, so that I do not have to key in the credentials every time I interact with the repositories. I <a href="https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/193#issuecomment-63040989">start the ssh-agent the very first time I open Cmder</a>, which prompts for my paraphrase and continues to run in the background. Alternatively, you can also use <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows">Credential Manager</a> to store credentials, when working with HTTP enabled Git repository. For the common commands, I have set up aliases like below, to save a bit on the keystrokes.</p>

<h3>Different workflows</h3>

<p>Git can be used in many ways and which makes it hard to get started. There are a few popular <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/">workflows</a> that one can use. Currently, I am using -  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow">Feature Branch workflow</a> -
which means that all work happen on independent feature branches and once completed gets merged into the main trunk (master branch). Code Reviews happens on the way it gets pulled into the main branch, which ensures code quality and familiarity.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow/01.svg"><img class="center" alt="Git Feature Branch Workflow" src="/images/git_featurebranch_workflow.png" /></a></p>

<h3>Not Just for Code</h3>

<p>Git is a version control system and does not limit itself to storing code. You can use it for <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/11/08/seven-ways-to-use-github-that-arent-coding/">version controlling any of your work</a>. For example, this blog is <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/rahulpnath.com">hosted on Github</a> and all the <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/rahulpnath.com/commits/master">changes are version controlled</a>, which gives me the flexibility to work and commit locally. Since the blog is <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/static-generator-is-all-a-blog-needs-moving-to-octopress/">static generated</a> I can also preview all the changes locally. I use git whenever I work on any documents or <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Speaking">presentations</a> so that I can avoid manual copy of files and renaming with suffixes like &lsquo;<em>Draft</em>, &rsquo;<em>Draft1</em>,<em>Final</em>,&ldquo;<em>FinalRevision</em>&lsquo; etc. (if that sounds any similar)</p>

<h3>Managing Commits</h3>

<p>When coming to commits, which are nothing but checkpoints of meaningful work done, people might have a different  definition for &lsquo;<em>meaningful</em>&rsquo; - for some it might be really granular, for others a bit coarse and for yet another it means all the work is done. I tend to commit quite often - even a rename of a variable leads to a commit so that I do not have to backtrack if at all something goes wrong immediately after that.</p>

<p>if you really like the idea of committing often (locally), but want the pushes to remotes more coarse, you can &lsquo;<strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git">squash your commits</a></strong>&rsquo;, before pushing it to remote branch. This allows you to commit often locally and still push  meaningful commit in the main source history. Make sure that the <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">commit messages and clear and communicates the intent</a> and helps <a href="http://megakemp.com/2014/08/14/the-importance-of-a-good-looking-history/">keep a good looking history</a>.</p>

<p>Git is one of the best things that happened to developers and hopes it stays long!</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>CLAL (Command Line Application Launcher) is a desktop application to launch any (currently supports only SQL Server Management Studio - <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162825.aspx">ssms</a>) command line application. It helps manage different configurations with which a command line application can be launched - such as different connection strings to various databases.</p>

<p><strong> <a href="http://bit.ly/1REGiFT">Install the latest version here</a> </strong></p>

<p>CLAL allows you to first specify the meta data of the command line application first and then create the various configurations for that by filling in the parameters as specified in the metadata. Currently since this only supports <em>ssms</em>, the metadata edit screen is not present and is hard coded into the application. The image below shows the various database servers that I connect to, and CLAL helps me reach them quickly</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Command Line Application Launcher" src="/images/clal.png" /></p>

<p>Use the &lsquo;<em>Add Configuration</em>&rsquo; button to add a new configuration. You can specify a <em>Friendly Name</em> for the configuration and then fill in the other details required by the command line. Alternatively for <em>ssms</em> you can also paste in a connection string and have all the fields automatically populated.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Command Line Application Launcher" src="/images/clal_new.png" /></p>

<p>Once new configuration is saved you can launch the application with the specified configuration either using the <em>Launch</em> button or double click on the configuration name in the list.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Work in progress to support other command line applications and to update the look and feel.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/clal/issues"><strong>Contribute</strong></a> to the development by coding or reporting issues that you find file using the application. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/clal/">Check out these articles</a> for my learnings while building this application.</p>

<p>In the earlier post, <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/refactoring-to-improve-testability-removing-unnecessary-dependencies/">Removing Unnecessary Dependencies</a>, we saw how having an unnecessary dependency hinders testability. In this post we will see just the opposite of that - extracting functionality out of a class and creating another class to separate responsibilities, making it easier to test and adhere to <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html">Single Responsibility Principle</a>(SRP).</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Violating Single Responsibility Principle makes writings tests harder.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Some of the common tests smell (from XUnit Test Patterns by Gerard Meszaros, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/language-agnostic-books-for-every-developer-2/">a recommended read</a>) that helps me to find these dependencies are <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Hard%20to%20Test%20Code.html">Hard-To-Test Code</a> and <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Fragile%20Test.html">Fragile Tests</a>. In this post we will explore the refactoring with the help of an example - I have to process usages (anything like electricity, internet, water etc.) for a list of locations aggregated over for a day. There is a repository where the last processed date for the location is stored, and whenever this process runs we have to process for all the days from the last processed date till the current day.</p>

<p>The existing code looks like below, which loops through a list of locations passed in, fetches the last processed date from a repository , gets all the days to be processed till today (<em>DateTime.Now.Date</em>) and processes them for all the days.</p>

<h3>Testability Issues with Current Design</h3>

<p>The code is self-explanatory and does what&rsquo;s expected. But what interests us more is the test code for this. From a test perspective we need to make sure
that for all locations, usages gets processed for the pending days. Direct cases when last processed day is a day before, a couple of days before and different for each location are some of the likely scenarios. Let&rsquo;s see one of the cases where the last processed day is a few days before for all locations</p>

<p>Clearly this is not the kind of tests that I want to write! It has a lot of setup code and even some logics to generate <em>expectedDates</em>. Let&rsquo;s see the various dependencies that the SUT has:</p>

<ul>
<li>ProcessUsagesForLocationOnDate on ILocationUsages</li>
<li>GetLastProcessedDateForLocation on IUsageRepository</li>
<li>List of locations that it&rsquo;s processing</li>
<li>Last processed date for each location</li>
<li>Dates pending processing as of today</li>
</ul>


<p>We clearly see that this one class does a lot more things than what its name suggests. Let&rsquo;s see how we can refactor this to improve our test code and manage the dependencies better.</p>

<h3>Refactoring the Code</h3>

<p>Finding all the dates till a given date (today in this case) is not this classes responsibility and can easily be pulled out. Since the SUT depends on <em>IUsageRepository</em> just to calculate the dates I can pull that out along with the refactoring. I have created a new interface, <em>IUsageDatesCalculator</em>, to return all the days pending process. With this interface, the test code looks a bit more clear and easier to write.</p>

<p>This looks better and easy to write - we do not have to write any code in the test to generate the expected dates. All I need is a list of dates (no matter is what order) and I need to make sure that process calls all of those. We would also pull out a separate interface to process for a location, instead of a list of locations. This will further remove the need to loop through the locations list in the test.</p>

<h3>DateTime and Tests</h3>

<p>Both in the original code and the refactored code, the logic that generates the dates to be processed depends on <em>DateTime.Now</em> for getting the current date. Though this looks perfectly fine, it makes testing harder. In the original test code, I had to generate expected dates based on today (system time).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good practice to inject a Time Provider into the consumer so that you can mock the value of Now(today) for tests. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.now(v=vs.110).aspx">DateTime.Now</a> is a static dependency on a class property and makes it hard for tests.
Even using a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2425739/1948745">static TimeProvider</a> and having overrides to set mocks for testing is not advised (also mentioned by Seemann in the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2425721/unit-testing-datetime-now/2425739#comment38623763_2425739">comments</a>), as it creates problems for parallel tests execution.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Inject a Time Provider into the consumer. Do not depend on any static time provider (including DateTime.Now)</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Refactoring the dependency with current time using a inject interface, <em>ITimeProvider</em>, makes setting the current day easy as shown in the tests below. I can now hard code my expected dates into the test code and not depend on a runtime generated list.</p>

<p>We have refactored various dependencies that the original code had and made it more testable. Testing is easier and <a href="https://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-01/unit-tests-are-first">repeatable</a>. Whenever writing tests become difficult - stop, think and refactor!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/toomore/23066277453" class="center" title="Image By Toomore Chiang, from https://www.flickr.com/photos/toomore/23066277453"><img src="/images\testing.jpg" class="center" alt="Testing"></a></p>

<p>In the earlier post, <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/refactoring-to-improve-testability-removing-unnecessary-dependencies/">Removing Unnecessary Dependencies</a>, we saw how having an unnecessary dependency hinders testability. In this post we will see how the test code changed by the refactoring we did for removing the unnecessary dependency and explore ways to control these changes.</p>

<h3>Impact on Tests by the Refactoring</h3>

<p>The refactoring in the last post involved a change in the updating the constructor signature to take in a string value instead of an interface. This broke a lot of our tests and forced us to change all constructor usages with the below code.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">anonymousName</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Anonymous Name&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">myService</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">MyService</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">otherDependency</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">anonymousName</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When seen in isolation, this is not much a change, but as the number of tests grows it becomes a pain. This definitely does not feel right. Breaking tests forces us out of <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/test%20first%20development.html">Test-First Development</a> and reduces the confidence in the tests and in the code.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The idea behind TDD was <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Red-Green-Refactor.html">Red-Green-Refactor</a>. But if tests break when Refactoring, then why follow TDD at all?</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Refactoring Tests</h3>

<p>Ideally, we should write tests that do not break when we refactor, so that it helps us to use the same tests over the refactored code. Let&rsquo;s see how we can improve the test code to prevent tests from breaking, when we refactor to <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/refactoring-to-improve-testability-removing-unnecessary-dependencies/">remove unnecessary dependency</a>. Below is the original code (<em>rewritten into xUnit and Moq, as I prefer that</em>) with the dependency on IAppSettings (which we will change it to string later)</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s analyze the test code for the dependencies that it has:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>UtilityMethod</em> of IMyOtherDependency</li>
<li><em>app.name</em> configuration value from IAppSettings</li>
<li><em>Constructor</em> of <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/SUT.html">System Under Test</a>(SUT) - MyService</li>
<li><em>PerformOperations</em> of SUT which is getting tested</li>
</ul>


<p>The test by itself verifies that calling <em>PerformOperations</em> returns true and UtilityMethod gets called once. It is not dependent on the value (&lsquo;My Test Application&rsquo;) returned by appSettings. The only need is that it should return some (dummy) value when asked for &lsquo;app.name&rsquo;. Assuming that there are multiple tests in this class that does the same setup of IAppSettings to return a dummy value you can start smelling <em>Cut-and-Paste code reuse for fixture setup</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Rule of Three: “The first time you do something, you just do it. Second time you do something similar, you wince at the duplication, but you do the duplicate thing anyway. The third time you do something similar, you refactor.”</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming">Rule of Three</a> is applicable even when writing test code and we should always keep an eye for duplication. <strong>It is easy to get lost in the thought that it&rsquo;s just test code and does not hurt to copy paste</strong>. Code duplication in test code does hurt and it hurts the most when you refactor production code.</p>

<p>So lets Refactor applying the <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/">various techniques</a> that we know of!</p>

<h4><strong><a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html">Extract Method</a></strong></h4>

<p><em>You have a code fragment that can be grouped together. Turn the fragment into a method whose name explains the purpose of the method.</em></p>

<p>Since we only depend on the <em>IMyOtherDependency</em> and the SUT instance instantiated with that, we can extract SUT creation with a given instance of IMyOtherDependency as below.</p>

<p>This starts taking us towards <strong><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html">Object Mother Pattern</a></strong>. It looks good to start with and might work well if all we have is the same <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Fixture%20Setup%20Patterns.html">fixture setup</a>. But if we have a different kind of fixture setup, with more dependency and combinations of setup, we will soon have a lot of similar creational methods with different combinations of parameters  - <em>GetMyServiceWithMyOtherDependencyAndAppSettings,GetMyServiceWithAppSettings</em> etc. The problem with having different methods is that all of them are dependent on the SUT constructor and set the same properties, leading to code duplication again.</p>

<h4><strong><a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/extractClass.html">Extract Class</a></strong></h4>

<p><em>You have one class doing work that should be done by two. Create a new class and move the relevant fields and methods from the old class into the new class.</em></p>

<p>With these new creational methods the test class is having more responsibility than it should actually have, so let&rsquo;s extract these creation methods into <em>MyServiceBuilder</em> class to see if we can further solve the problem.</p>

<p>This takes us to <strong><a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html">Test Data Builder Pattern</a></strong> and as we notice we have reduced the dependency on the MyService constructor to just one and only place where we need to change if the constructor signature changes. Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">Cyclomatic Complexity</a> of <em>MyServiceBuilder</em> is one it is fine not to write tests for it   . Using the new builder class our original test case now looks like below.</p>

<p>Now the test is just dependent on the objects that it needs. If all the test use <em>MyServiceBuilder</em>, we can now easily refactor to <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/refactoring-to-improve-testability-removing-unnecessary-dependencies/">Remove the Unnecessary Dependency</a> on IAppSettings, by just changing the <em>MyServiceBuilder</em> to use a string property. We will also need to change tests that use the <em>WithAppSettings</em> method which is expected, as those tests are dependent on the app settings value in the first place and so the tests definitely need to be re-written.</p>

<h3>Generic Test Data Builder</h3>

<p>We could have essentially stopped at the above step, but then we realize that it is too much work to create a Test Data Builder class for each of the production code classes that we have. It takes a lot out of the <a href="http://keysleft.com/">finite number of keystrokes left in your hands</a> and you definitely don&rsquo;t want to waste that in typing redundant code. This is where we can use
<a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture">AutoFixture</a>, that is an open source library for .NET that helps reduce the <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Four%20Phase%20Test.html">Setup</a>/<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ArrangeActAssert">Arrange</a> phase. Using <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/10/08/AutoDataTheorieswithAutoFixture/">AutoData Theories with AutoFixture</a> our test case now looks like below.</p>

<p>The test code does not have any dependency on the constructor of the SUT and a change in constructor signature does not affect our tests at all. We can refactor <em>MyService</em> and use the same tests as long as the functionality served by the class remains the same. Constructors are implementation details and it&rsquo;s better to keep tests independent of it. This keeps our test code clean and more robust!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/5Ntkpxqt54Y" class="center" title="Image By Sai Kiran Anagani, from https://unsplash.com/photos/5Ntkpxqt54Y"><img src="/images\refactoring.jpg" class="center" alt="Refactoring"></a></p>

<p>Nowadays I am trying to stick to <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd">TDD</a> (with the test first approach) and have found it to be of great help. One of the biggest reward doing TDD is that it helps me to <a href="https://vimeo.com/97419151">stay in the flow</a> and regain speed faster after a distraction. This post explains how to refactor code to remove unnecessary dependencies, which is easily found when writing tests.</p>

<p>Unnecessary dependencies are those components which a <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/SUT.html">SUT</a> depends on, but does not directly affect any of its functionalities. Some of the common tests smell (from XUnit Test Patterns by Gerard Meszaros, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/language-agnostic-books-for-every-developer-2/">a recommended read</a>) that helps me to find these dependencies are <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Code%20Duplication.html">Test Code Duplication</a> and <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Fragile%20Test.html">Fragile Tests</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Cut-and-Paste code reuse for fixture setup happens often when there is an unnecessary dependency.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>While looking for an example to write on, I came across a post from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/zpbappi">Bappi</a>, where he explains <a href="http://zpbappi.com/testing-codes-with-configurationmanager-appsettings/">Testing Codes with ConfigurationManager</a>. It&rsquo;s a good read on how to remove the dependency with various Configuration Providers by creating an abstraction over it.</p>

<h3>Testability Issues with Current Design</h3>

<p>While abstracting the Configuration Manager by using an interface is a good idea, you should also be careful on how the application classes depend on it. Configurations live at the application root and it is a good idea to restrict dependencies with it at that level. Rest of the application must be dependent only on the configuration value and not the configuration itself. Inner components having dependency with the  configuration provider brings in unnecessary complexities and makes code fragile. Some common issues are</p>

<ul>
<li>Class needs to know of Configuration key</li>
<li>Extra mocking while testing</li>
</ul>


<p>As you see below, the test case from the original post has to set up the Configuration provider mock to return values before testing the class. MyService (assuming that it is not a Factory class, which I confirmed from Bappi) is unnecessarily depending on IAppSettings and coupling itself with the configuration name, which really is not its concern. This leads to brittle code and tests!</p>

<h3>Refactoring the Code</h3>

<p>Refactoring such code is as easy as removing the dependency on IAppSettings and taking in the value of &lsquo;app.name&rsquo; as the dependency. This removes the interface dependency and requires only the string value to be passed in. Here I am passing in <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ploeh/2008/11/17/anonymous-variables/">an anonymous Name</a>, as the value is not of concern for this test.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>When looked at isolation these are minor code changes that hardly removes a line or two. But it has a cumulative effect when applied to all the tests for the class and makes code more robust.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>When looked at isolation, this is a seemingly minor change of not mocking an interface and is just one line of code, which you could live with. But you need to mock that for all tests of that class, which is when you start to see the real benefit. Also, you have made the tests more resilient by not taking an unnecessary dependency. Even if you decide to change the configuration name to &lsquo;<em>ApplicationName</em>&rsquo;, none of the tests break now, whereas with the original code all of them would have.</p>

<p><em>One possible argument with this refactoring is, <strong> What if I need an extra value from the dependency (app.domain in the above case), I now have to update the class constructor</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Agreed, but then this violates <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/12/TheOpenClosedPrinciple.html">Open Closed Principle</a>, which states &lsquo;You should be able to extend a classes behaviour without modifying it.&rsquo; If you need a new configuration value, you are essentially changing the components functionality, so you should either extend current functionality or write a new component. This also opens up a hidden code smell with the existing code and an anti-pattern - <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/02/03/ServiceLocatorisanAnti-Pattern/">Service Locator</a>. So the refactoring still holds good!</p>

<p>Hope this helps you find dependencies with unnecessary components and remove them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><em>This article is to put my thoughts together on a possible solution. Challenges of real world implementation are yet to be discovered.</em></p>

<p>Handling date/time in application&rsquo;s that affect different time zones is tricky! The general recommendation is that all dates be saved in UTC time and convert them as required. This works well if developers make sure of converting all dates to UTC at application boundaries and keep it consistent throughout the application.</p>

<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/yBzrPGLjMQw" class="center" title="Image By Heather Zabriskie , from https://unsplash.com/photos/yBzrPGLjMQw"><img src="/images\timezone.jpg" class="center" alt="Timezone"></a></p>

<p>At one of my clients, we are facing similar issues with date time, with an application that deals with different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">time zones</a>. The client sells office spaces across the globe and the application is for their employees to manage their clients. It integrates with various back-end systems and provides a single point of access for everything, aggregating data across those different  systems and itself. Some of the backend systems are in different locations and deal with times local to them. This increases the challenge when sending and retrieving data from them. The application has defined a set of locations, identified by, three-letter codes (<em>SYD, TRV, SEA</em>), and these locations fall under different time zones. Office spaces are at these locations and the application allows to manage those from anywhere.</p>

<p>Across the domain, we use either <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime(v=vs.110).aspx">DateTime</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetimeoffset(v=vs.110).aspx">DateTimeOffset</a> to represent time - there is a good recommendation on when to use what - <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384267(v=vs.110).aspx">Choosing Between DateTime, DateTimeOffset, TimeSpan, and TimeZoneInfo</a>. The problem with using either is that it does not play well with the domain concept to where time is related to - the location. We do have property name suffixes (not consistent though) indicating whether it is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or local - like <em>bookingDateUTC</em>, <em>paymentDateLocal</em> etc. But it so happens that these naming conventions gets broken somewhere along the different layers and leads to conversion between time zone at the application boundary layers.</p>

<h3>Issues with Current Approach</h3>

<p>DateTime and DateTimeOffset have by default time zones attached to it and it might go unnoticed till we face issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.kind(v=vs.110).aspx">Kind</a> property on DateTime indicates whether the time represents a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/shx7s921(v=vs.110).aspx">local time, UTC or neither</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetimeoffset.offset(v=vs.110).aspx">Offset</a> property on DateTimeOffset indicates the time&rsquo;s offset from UTC</li>
</ul>


<p>A common scenario in the current application is user selects a date time in the UI using a date picker, which gets send to the server as a string. This value flows through the entire system and is used to populate external systems. The problem here is that the time zone of the date time is not clear. The developer might treat this as UTC time, system local time or even time local to the location in context. This gives different results to the end user and puts the system in an inconsistent state.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Even worse this date time might get converted back and forth to different time zones, even by the same developer or other developers in the team. These conversions implicitly depend on the Kind property and goes unnoticed. One of the most common problems that we see as a result of this is that the dates might fall over to a day before or after or after, depending on where in the world the user, the server running the application is.</p>

<h3>Being Explicit Using Value Objects</h3>

<blockquote><p><em>The issue in dealing with time is about not being explicit. It&rsquo;s a good idea to tie your domain concept (location in this case) and time together</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Since time is always tied to a location (<em>SYD, TRV, SEA</em>) it&rsquo;s better to keep these together. Though DateTimeOffset and DateTime already has a timezone information attached it does not fit well into the domain, it makes more sense to have a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/thinking-beyond-primitive-values-value-objects/">Value Object</a> encapsulating time and location. Timezone by itself is less likely to fit into a domain unless time zones are a domain concept. Most likely the domain would be dealing with a location, place, airport, station etc which falls under a timezone. So it&rsquo;s a good idea to tie your domain concept and the time together. Only for the creation of the Value Object, we need the location after which it is the date time it represents that is relevant. But if by default you want to get back the date time for the same location it was created for, then location can be saved along with the Value Object. In our case, we always want to show the time at the location, so I am keeping it in the Value Object.</p>

<p>The Value Object mandates that all date time gets tracked as UTC and allows conversion to time at different locations. The public constructor enforces this by checking the Kind property on DateTime.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The Value Object Equality is only on the UTC time it represents</em></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/blob/master/ExplicitAboutDateTime/ExplicitAboutDateTime/Location.cs">Location</a> is another Value Object, that encapsulates the code, name and the time zone it belongs to. There is a factory method that allows the creation of the value object at a location, which assumes any passed in DateTime as the time at location, and mandates the Kind property is Unspecified. You could update this to accept UTC/Local time depending on the passed in location&rsquo;s time zone, checking if both fall under the same time zone. You can also create an implicit operator to cast to DateTime or DateTimeOffset values and have it return the desired date time value that you want.</p>

<p>All occurrences of datetime in model classes can now be replaced with custom datetime value object. This makes creating a date explicit and mandates developers to make a decision on the location of datetime.</p>

<p>Even with the above code, you cannot restrict what gets passed into the API/application boundary method, but this has made it explicit to the application on how to start treating the date time. This forces the developer to think and be explicit on the time format expected at the boundary. This might lead to better naming of the variables at the boundary - instead of <em>dateTime</em> to <em>dateTimeAtLocation</em> - and being more explicit to the outside world too!</p>

<h3>Custom Factories Using Extension Method</h3>

<p>Depending on the use case there will be a lot of ways you want to create the value object and possibility of some being used over and over again is more. You can use factory methods to help you extract out this code duplication.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin">Uncle Bob</a> points out in <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0131857258/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=0131857258&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21&amp;linkId=VVMXRINDZWYFRWP4">Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#</a>, interfaces should be closer to the client. <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/12/24/placement-of-abstract-factories/">Factories are nothing but an interface</a>, so it should be defined closer to where it&rsquo;s consumed. Creating a LocationDateTime is always tied to a DateTime object. Using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-AU/library/bb383977.aspx">Extension Methods</a> in C#, I have defined an extension on DateTime to create a LocationDateTime object.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now creating a LocationDateTime from a DateTime is easy. Similarly, extension methods can be defined on Location, LocationDateTime to provide custom capabilities as required by the consuming clients.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">locationDateTime</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">dateTimeAtLocation</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ToLocationDateTime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">location</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By using a Value Object to represent the DateTime within the application enforces developers to be more explicit on the date time at the boundaries, results in better naming of the variables at boundaries, ensures that it remains the same within the application. You can also override some of the most commonly used operators with DateTime like greater than, less than, equal to, so that it seamlessly fits into the application.</p>

<p>Hoping this will work well in the application too, let me get on to fix it!</p>
