  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Most of the people switching to WPF,got to understand the fact the WPF tries to target one major problem of the technologies that existed before, which was tight coupling of the design and the behaviour.WPF has a ‘<em>lookless control model</em>’,and that simply means that the look and feel of the control is completely separated from the behaviour of the  control.And that is where the whole concept of XAML comes in,which does its part of defining the visual representation.</p>

<p>But still many people move on to WPF from older technologies fail to absorb this core approach.Mostly this happens when the look of something is to be dynamically generated.Say in the case of a Listbox bound to a itemssource.As far as the item is to be displayed in pure text everything goes fine.People figure out that the <em>DisplayMemberPath</em> has to be set to the property that they want to be displayed in the listbox.
 &#8220;` csharp
 private void Window_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
          listBox1.ItemsSource = PopulateEmployees();
        }</p>

<pre><code>    private static List&lt;Employee&gt; PopulateEmployees()
    {
        List&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new List&lt;Employee&gt;();
        Employee emp;
        for int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        {
            emp = new Employee()
            {
                FirstName = "Name",
                LastName = i.ToString(),
                Id = i
            };
            employees.Add(emp);
        }
        return employees;
    }
}

class Employee
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

   public string LastName { get; set; }

    public int&lt;/span&gt; Id { get; set; }
}
```
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/binding_displaymemberpath.jpg" alt="binding displaymemberpath" /></p>

<p>But the scenario changes when the item to be displayed has to be more informative.Say you need a image to come up with some text,or maybe a button/checkbox etc.Now people tend to shift to the older approaches of creating the listbox items display from code.As that’s how it had been done before and also that seems easier.</p>

<p>The code changes to something similar to shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/binding_code_behind.jpg" alt="binding code behind" /></p>

<p>Or another approach might be slightly better than this one,by creating a user control to hold this data and then create the User control in the code behind and then add that to the listbox items.</p>

<p>This is where people tend to loose focus of the real power of WPF ..<strong>Templating</strong>.</p>

<p>All this code can be easily replaced and also clearly separate that UI details from the behaviour.The property that&rsquo;s the key here is <em>ItemTemplate,</em>and this would how the new code look like.</p>

<p><img src="/images/binding_data_template.jpg" alt="binding data template" /></p>

<p>And the code in the behind all vanishes,and is as simple in our first case,by just setting up the listbox1’s ItemsSource.</p>

<p>That is the power of templating and clearly separates the UI aspect from code. Any ItemsControl will have the property ItemTemplate that is to be set to the way you want the data to be displayed.If the display is complex in itself then you can move those into a separate user control and create  that user control  as the ItemTemplate.Anytime you want to change the way your control looks you just need to change in the xaml,clearly bringing in the decoupling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Every time one of my friends asks,&lsquo;<em>Hey how to start off with WPF</em>&rsquo;,I think of putting up a post,so that I could easily direct them and say,&lsquo;<em>Hey check out my post in my blog</em>&rsquo;.Maybe from the next time I would :)</p>

<p>There are a lot of blogs that describes on how to Kick start WPF,and this is my version of it.</p>

<p>WPF is just like any other technology that you would love to learn,except for the fact that not all technologies are cool..but WPF really is and you would enjoy every bit learning it.</p>

<p>Books would be the best source to kick start the learning,as the topics would be covered in a organized manner,so that you wouldn&rsquo;t need to hunt down the meaning of something new that you would come across.Some suggested books on WPF are</p>

<p>There are a lot of other books too that are good,but personally I found this as good for beginners.</p>

<p>Some of the must know things as far as WPF is concerned would be its Layout mechanism(Mathew&rsquo;s book gives a good explanation of that),Binding mechanism(Adams book should be good for that ).Also do understand the concept of Resources,Styles and Templates  if you would be playing the role of UX developer :).Otherwise also those are good to know concepts.</p>

<p>As with any technology developing a &lsquo;Hello World&rsquo; kind of application is easy.Its in about understanding the best practices,patterns that are best supported and implementing things the way they were actually meant to be.Same holds true for WPF too :)MVVM is one such pattern thats most talked about in WPF.There is a very good <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx/">article</a> by Josh Smith.There is also a book by him,Advanced MVVM,if you are interested in detail.Also do check out <a href="http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/">Prism </a>that is by the Microsoft P&amp;P team.It provides a very good guidance on how to go about developing applications.</p>

<p>You would also find lots of videos in <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/wpf">channel9</a>,which should also be a good source of information.</p>

<p>Blogs are another source of information,and lots of people seems to be in love with WPF,including me :)Almost all the major contributors to WPF are part of <a href="http://wpfdisciples.wordpress.com/">WPF disciples</a>,from which you can easily navigate to their respective blogs.</p>

<p>For anything else there is always the <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en/wpf/threads/">MSDN forum</a>,with people all round the world ready to answer your questions.Feel free to post any specific doubts that you come across.</p>

<p>Finally all reading and no implementing makes little use.So get a Visual Studio up and running and try things side by side..and soon you would find yourself good in WPF :)</p>

<p>Welcome to WPF :)</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>It&rsquo;s not been that long that I&rsquo;ve been into the IT servicing industry.But still the learning curve I&rsquo;ve had during the  past few years has been dramatic.The first time I was put into a &lsquo;<em>live client facing project</em>&rsquo; was almost one year after my industry entry.</p>

<p>Now what is the key takeaway from this post?</p>

<p>Nothing much maybe for a seasoned IT developer/professional.I am just trying to explain out what to look out for when developing an enterprise application as a beginner.How to approach things. Definitely its not like building an application that you might be used to creating during your college days(if at all you were ,coz I used not :) ).I was puzzled on where to start ,how to approach things,whats the right way.Here&rsquo;s what I figured out for my questions through my experiences.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the disclamer&hellip;.All views are just that of mine and only mine,just in case &hellip;.. :)</p>

<p>First thing I understood is there is nothing like &lsquo;<em>perfect resource</em>&rsquo; for a project.It&rsquo;s just that resources are molded to fit the requirement and the technologies.So you have to live with it and learn things the hard way.Try to get a view of things from a higher altitude,which means above technology.Try to understand the concept on which things are based on,rather than on how to use the particular implementation of a concept.For example a person working on .net should be flexible enough to move on to Java or any other OO(Object Oriented) language(this one is a personal experience again ).So trying to relate you learnings to OO concepts and seeing how it is implemented in .net would make you easily jump to a different language.Because you know what exactly to look out for there too.</p>

<p>On an implementation level,the process model that we had followed for the project,was waterfall,which by itself created a lot of problems on the requirement side.As the model advocates there was a big &lsquo;<em>upfront design</em>&rsquo; phase ,the output of which had very little resemblance to what came out in the end.But still it did exist with the key players being those like me,who were all just puzzled as I was,on what to do.Here I would like to mention the things that I felt towards the end of implementation,that I felt that I should have done during this phase.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Should have known/read of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> ,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)">GRASP</a> principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Awareness of certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)">design patterns</a> would have helped to create a better design.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Different approaches might be taken to tackle the same problem.But always make sure that the common cross cutting concerns are handled in a centralized manner.This includes things like exception handling,error logging,data validation,transaction and many other things.Handling this in a centralized manner makes things easier for you and targeting changes relating to any of these in an elegant,simple manner.The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc467894.aspx">Enterprise Library</a> is one such example which assists in the .net world.You could probably come up with your own frameworks.But always make sure you have,because I have learned this too..the hard way.</p>

<p>Refactoring,improving the design of the code after it has been written,is one process that any developer should start doing at his level,and better if implemented at a team level too.This really helps to remove &lsquo;smelly code&rsquo; and also improve your design.It&rsquo;s true that most developers switch job when they start hating ,see their own code &lsquo;<em>rot</em>&rsquo;.Recheck the disclaimer, if you don&rsquo;t agree.This can be avoided to some extent by refactoring I guess,An added advantage to refactoring maybe :)</p>

<p>Presentation layer/UI layer is the one part that people tend to develop a bit fast,because they want to see something of their own efforts.Make sure you have a architectural pattern targeting this like MVC,PM,MVP,MVVM etc.This is really important,again something  learnt the hard way.Don&rsquo;t just go ahead the &lsquo;<em>drag&#8217;n drop-double click-write code</em>&rsquo; way which is highly supported in Visual Studio(for .net) or any other IDE&rsquo;s.This seems easy to start with,but as time and code starts growing it becomes a pain.Make sure your logics are neatly separated and highly re-used.UI is one part where re usability comes down,and this is mostly because of the lack of proper use of architectural patterns as mentioned above.</p>

<p>Through my experiences,I learned that there is no such &lsquo;<em>one right way</em>&rsquo; of doing things,but its in how well you do things the way that you do matters.It&rsquo;s in how well you manage your dependencies that matter in the last,and thats what counts.Even now,having had an experience in a project,I am no good in this.Its just that I have learned some of the ways that things should not be done.</p>

<p>Some of the books that I found very helpful,though I have not read all cover-to-cover are :</p>

</ol>


<p>Some of these books are technology specific,but most of them are not.Its just gives an approach to doing things,just using a technology as a medium of explaining.</p>

<p>Not sure whether this post would really target all audience,but if I had got to read some vague tips like this,the first time I face an enterprise project,it would have helped better,better in the sense,to make less mistakes maybe :)</p>

<p>Meantime got into a little bit of Expression blend,which would be an indispensable tool when working with WPF/Silverlight.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Just a though on a new mail attachment way :).</p>

<p>What if we could attach existing attachments in our mailbox to new mails that we want to send.Forwarding the mail that had the attachment might not be a good solution in many a cases.</p>

<p>The key point here is that attachments should be like a resource,that can be shared across mails,that can be deleted edited or updated.</p>

<p>There could be a small widget showing all attachments that you have in your mailbox,from which you can add whatever you want to your current mail.</p>

<p>I think this would be a cool feature in the present email system.</p>

<p>You would not end up uploading the same file again and again :)</p>

<p>Feel free to comment on this idea ::)</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/wp7-application-model/" itemprop="url">WP7 Application Model</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Mobile phones should be always responsive,highly responsive infact.If it&rsquo;s not responding within 10 to 15 seconds,the users hits the switch off button or removes the battery to reset the phone&hellip;.I have done this many a times.</p>

<p>The WP7 application model allows only 1 application to be running at a time.But its not that bad that you have to always start from the beginning of an app if you switch away from it.Whenever you switch away from an app,it just goes into a hibernation mode,tombstoning to be more precise.Whenever a user switches between applications,the phone activates and deactivates the applications.Events are raised to notify this activating and deactivating so that the developers can handle them and maintain the state of the application between switches,as if it was just back there running.A user may also explicitly close down an application by pressing the back button on the device at the first page of the application.</p>

<p>On start of a new instance of an application,which happens whenever an application is opened other than by switching to it using the back button,a launching event is raised after which the application moves on into the running state.It&#8217;s advised not to perform any time consuming activities in the Launching event handler,as any latency of more than 10 seconds causes the application to be bought down by the phone.So any IsolatedStorage access is recommended to be done after the application is up and running,making the app more responsive,which is our primary goal.On normal close the application raises a Closing event,where you might be saving persistent data to the IsolatedStorage.Data relating to a particular instance of application need not be saved here as the only way now to start the application is coming right from the beginning,raising the Launching even all over again.Again saving to the IsolatedStorage can be a little tricky.If it takes more than 10 seconds,the application will be terminated forcefully.The key here is that any data to be persisted should be done as and when you have the data and in a asynchronous manner.The earlier this happens the better it is for your application.Otherwise you may run into forceful termination of your application and loosing data and thereby decreasing you application&#8217;s reliability and use.</p>

<p>Tombstoning opens up a whole new path for the application lifecylcle,introducing additional two events,Activated and Deactivated.The State Dictionary maintained by the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.phone.shell.phoneapplicationservice(v=VS.92).aspx">PhoneApplicationService</a>(which also provides all the above mentioned events) is kept as is between application switches.That is whatever is saved in that before deactivating the app will be available after the application is activated.This is how maintaining application state is achieved between application switches.On start of a new application instance the State Dictionary would be empty.Data that is required for just a particular application instance goes into the State Dictionary and the data that is required for all application instances gets saved into the IsolatedStorage.Applications may get tombstoned due to many reasons.It maybe due to user hitting the start button when in an application,launching choosers or launchers(in some cases of doesn&rsquo;t get tombstoned,but its always better to handle for this),due to phone going into idle state(which again can be handled).</p>

<p>The below diagram,as from msdn, gives the complete picture of the application model.</p>

<p><img src="/images/wp7_application_model.png" alt="wp7 application model" /></p>

<p>Getting a good idea of the application model is important to build highly responsive,reliable application for the Windows Phone 7.</p>

<p>Not this post but&hellip;aaaahh&hellip;.procrastination!!!!!</p>

<p>No definitely not  (atleast to keep myself happy ;)).</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Need not much of an explanation I guess.
The title has it all&hellip;.
&hellip;.a C# API for searching images from google.
Works on Regex for matching the image URL from the HTML returned for the image tag search.This might stop working anytime google changes the formatting.
Even the current regex is not returning all the images from a page.Working on that though..would be fixed in the next release<em>.
I started this to try the AsynEnumerator from <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/Resources/Downloads">PowerThreading </a>Library by Wintellect.
I guess i&rsquo;ve not understood it fully and there is an overuse of it in this version..that too would be looked into the next release</em>.</p>

<p>Download VS2010 source <a href="http://rahulpnath.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/imagesearch_2010.jpg">code</a> (right click and save link as and  rename to .rar)
Download VS2008 source <a href="http://rahulpnath.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/imagesearch_2008.jpg">code</a> (right click and save link as and  rename to .rar)</p>

<p>PS: Since the search results format is changing often the code might not work sometimes.Doing my best to keep it updated and working.Do check the comments too to see if the regex match string is changed.Sometimes I might not get time to update the solution,but would just leave a comment.Latest comment should be the best to match with :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Quite often in the client-server model,the requirement of getting notified of certain changes in the server pops up.Say for example in the movie ticket booking system.When a person selects a seat for booking,the selected seat should become disabled for all the users currently logged in,so that you can avoid the message &lsquo;Sorry the seat you were trying to book is already booked&rsquo;.<br/>
In such scenarios polling the server for changes might be one way to go about it.<br/>
Another way might be the server calling back to all the clients when a seat selection happens.<br/>
This post is about the second way and when the booking system is developed using WCF :)<br/>
The WCF framework provides a easy way to achieve this&hellip;..<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.servicecontractattribute.callbackcontract.aspx">Callbacks</a></p>

<p>The whole concept is simple.The server keeps track of all the active clients and knows how to call them when the required change happens in the server.<br/>
Again its all about certain interfaces that you have implement  and some attributes that you have to specify.<br/>
The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.servicecontractattribute.aspx">ServiceContract</a> that the client exposes also specifies the CallbackContract type.This is again another interface that the client needs to implement so that the server knows the type of client it is serving and can call back the functions on that interface.<br/>
This is much more like the eventing model.All functions in the CallbackContract would be like your event handlers,which would be invoked by the server on a particular event happening in the server.<br/>
You can go ahead and create a Publisher-Subscriber framework itself so that any future requirements of such nature would be easy to implement<br/>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163537.aspx#S6">This </a>article by Juval Lowy suggest a good way to implement a publisher-subscriber framework in WCF using callbacks.</p>

<p>The code provided below shows a quick example of Callbacks.Run minimum of two clients,so you get to understand what it is all about :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Introduce Foreign Method(<a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/introduceForeignMethod.html">IFM</a>) and Introduce Local Extension(<a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/introduceLocalExtension.html">ILE</a>) are two refactoring techniques that comes handy when you need to add functionality to an exisiting class,source code of which is beyond your control.
IFM is used when its just one or two functions that you need to add to the class.When the number of functions,that are to be added are more,then ILE is used.Not a rule though :)
But now with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977.aspx">Extension Methods</a> the whole process is much more simpler.
You need not do the subclassing or wrapper technique of ILE.
This can be a third way of implementing ILE :).Thanks to the framework team for keeping it simple.
The same date example using the &lsquo;Extension Methods&rsquo; way of refactoring</p>

<p>The function NextDay is now available on any DateTime object,just as if you have written if you had access to the source code. It&rsquo;s the usage of ILE and IFM that has paved way for the inclusion of Extension Methods in the framework I guess.Thanks to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Fowler </a>for that.
