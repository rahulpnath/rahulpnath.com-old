  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Windows Communication Foundation(WCF) brought around a unified programming model for building service oriented application.All the previous technologies that was used to build services like MSMQ, remoting, ASMX Web Services,all came under one umbrella.</p>

<p>WCF had embraced SOAP,moving away from the <a href="http://rahulpnath.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/rest-after-a-long-time/">restful web</a> giving all sorts of flexibility and configurability.Everyone was happy for sometime thinking about the power that actually WCF gave by just changing a set of configurations and embraced it entirely.But then most of this configuration did not apply to many of the user scenario,and just went unused,coming with the extra ‘baggage’ that SOAP had to carry around.</p>

<p>I found Scott’s summary the best,as in this <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/264/this-is-not-your-fathers-wcf-all-about-the-webapi-with-glenn-block">podcast</a>,when he speaks of WCF</p>

<blockquote><p>”<em>If you are giving me an api whose strong point is it can talk over multi transport and has abstracted me away from the details that i actually need in the name of flexibility that i am not going to use,then that is just baggage</em>”</p></blockquote>

<p>WCF had its own way of being restful,so came WCF WebHTTP,WCF Rest Starter Kit and even a WCF Web Api.Apparently ASP.NET MVC,which is inherently restful,was also having getting capabilities to build basic web Api’s.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc4">ASP.NET MVC 4</a> , both the paths that REST had taken merges as <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.NET Web API</a>.     <br/>
So yes this is the ideal platform for building Restful services on the .NET Framework.    <br/>
Web API is nothing but services exposed over http,providing reach to various devices and platforms without doubt,as http is supported across platforms and devices.SOAP did use http,but it used it more as a transport than an application protocol,by sending message packets over http.But with Web Api the ‘contract’ is the actions of HTTP –GET ,PUT ,POST ,DELETE etc..</p>

<p>All said WCF still holds good in cases where SOAP is necessary,where it was actually intended to be used.It’s just the REST’ful part take a new form.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Blogs are always a very good medium to express our thoughts,views,knowledge and much more.In cases of where you blog on topics new to you,blogging can also be a way to learn and to get feedback.</p>

<p>But what good does it come to if the reader base for your blogs are less.It&rsquo;s true that with social sites like Facebook,twitter etc you stand a better chance to publicize your blogs more and increase your reader base.But still it has its own limitations as not all of the people that follows you might be interested in the topics that you blog.<del>So the best thing would be to find communities/group blogs that relate to topics that you commonly blog on and contribute there.</del></p>

<p><del>Being in Microsoft I have this privilege of having a space in the msdn blogs.Its been a long time since I had started an account <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rahulpnath/">there</a> and kept thinking on what to post.I think its high time to start off with that and enjoy one of the biggest reader base for technical topics.</del></p>

<p><del>Why from today but???&hellip;..Thanks to the guys who motivated me to move on and venture out. :)
</del></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Yes I still do have the privilege, but I think it is better to have it here in my on domain than anywhere else, as it will always be mine. So I have decided to keep all my thoughts and posts on this site. I have even moved from wordpress hosting to a self hosted one so I have more control.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>It&rsquo;s not been too long since I have been  into Web development,but I have already started hearing the buzz word every now and then.</p>

<p>REpresentational State Transfer(REST).</p>

<p>Aaron Skonnard left me with enough curiosity and confusions with his <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/blogs/matthijs/why-rest-by-aaron-skonnard">Why we need REST</a> talk,to make me dig deeper into it.It takes more time to unlearn things than to learn .With REST it was really something like that.There was this whole concept of SOAP and its API&rsquo;s that came to my mind every now and then.But then is it actually SOAP that REST is trying to replace.Actually no.It&rsquo;s basically an alternate way to Remote Procedure Call(RPC) methodology and it so happens that almost all the SOAP implementation use RPC today.SOAP gave a lot of things out of the box,but most of it never got used,which meant it was just adding up complexity unnecessarily.But as always it&rsquo;s never a &lsquo;SOAP vs REST&rsquo;,it&rsquo;s about what you are trying to achieve that would drive the decision.</p>

<p>REST simplifies a lot on the interface that is exposed to the client.As for REST there is not explicit &lsquo;<em>contracts</em>&rsquo;  to be specified.The HTTP verbs,GET,PUT POST and DELETE are the interface that is used in REST.This makes it much simple and uniform.Also rest takes a Resource Oriented programming where everything under consideration is a resource and the HTTP interface acts on that.At an implementation level you would still have functions for any of those Create,Read,Update and Delete(CRUD) operations,with the only difference being it would be all mapped to the HTTP verbs.</p>

<p>As for WCF is concerned you have 2 attributes,WebGet and WebInvoke, that would decorate you functions to indicate the mapping with the http interface.WebGet is used to map to the GET of http and all other verbs map to WebInvoke,which inturn has Method property that indicates what method of http it actually maps to.</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="na">[WebInvoke(Method = &quot;PUT&quot;, UriTemplate = &quot;users/{username}&quot;)]</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As seen in the above snippet,the same resource,users,supports 2 different kind of methods to be invoked on it.So the function that actually gets invoked would be decided by the Http.So you see the client never calls a GetUserDetails or PutNewUser.All it knows is HTTP and its interface,which gives a uniformity across resources and also makes life simple.</p>

<p>REST is an architectural style,so obviously you need to shift your thought process from previous styles that you would have been exposed to.Wherever you see about REST,it mentions about the basic operations of CRUD over a resource.So often the thought of &lsquo;<em>Are only these operations are suported?</em>&rsquo; comes.So here is one of the shifts in thinking that you would have to think.In REST everything is a resource,be it a person or some activity that he does.So as long as you have different resources for everything you only end up doing the CRUD operations on all those.So its about how you model out these resources.For eg.A transaction that you might need to do can by itself be a resource,over which you would end up doing the basic CRUD operations</p>

<p>Another powerful feature that REST uses is Caching that is inbuilt into the HTTP.Right from no caching to conditional caching can be achieved very easily for your rest services.This reduces the number of roundtrips  and makes a better use of the bandwidth.This is one important feature that makes web what it is today,and you have this power at your disposal,with actually no or very little work.Details on HTTP caching and different machanisms are <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html">here</a></p>

<p>With ASP.NET MVC,you can expose you website also as a service,more interestingly you can do that in a RESTful manner.This makes your website to be used not only by humans but also by machines/programs.You would be using AcceptVerbs attribute as you used WebInvoke/WebGet for WCF.This makes it easy for you to expose your website itself as a service.You can have it return HTML for humans and JSON/XML/any other data format for a machine/program.</p>

<p>REST really makes things simpler and its more towards the way originally the web was intended to be.There is a very good article again by Aaron on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd203052.aspx">Building restful services</a>.</p>

<p>Now I need some REST ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>It’s been a long time since i have posted here,and indeed a lot did happen during this time,things that were really exciting too.Lots of things also coincides with my mobile journey too.</p>

<p>Events in chronological order :)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Microsoft decides to  give a WP7 phone to all its employees,for free <img src="http://rahulpnath.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/wlemoticon-surprisedsmile.png" alt="Surprised smile" /></p></li>
<li><p>I happened to attend an interview at Microsoft and guess what …<img src="http://rahulpnath.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/wlemoticon-surprisedsmile.png" alt="Surprised smile" /><img src="http://rahulpnath.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/wlemoticon-surprisedsmile.png" alt="Surprised smile" /></p></li>
<li><p>My joining date was luckily enough,so that I could get the <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/7mozart/overview.html">HTC Mozart 7</a> for free.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><img src="/images/htc_mozart7_wp.jpg" alt="htc_mozart7_wp" /></p>

<p>Over the last week I did register for the developer licence and its pretty simple too,apart from the fee that you would have to pay(luckily enough for me,that’s also free).Even otherwise the amount is nominal,if you are serious enough to develop apps for the phone.In a short span of time you should be able to earn back whatever you have spent for the licence.To register for the licence all you need to do is follow the instructions found <a href="http://create.msdn.com/en-US/">here</a>.Once you get your registration done,it takes a couple of days to get you account activated,after the verification process.Then you can add devices to your account using phoneReg.exe(Windows Phone Developer Registration from start menu),which gets installed when you install the phone developer tools,which is also available in the above link provided.Here is a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff769508(v=vs.92).aspx">link</a> that describes on how to go with the registration.I did face some issues here while registering the device from my personal laptop,but got it done from office laptop.Not sure on what exactly caused the problem.There are a list of troubleshooting options mentioned in the above link and <a href="http://forums.create.msdn.com/forums/p/73498/451621.aspx">this</a> too might help.You would not be stuck up too long but and hopefully that would be resolved soon too I guess.</p>

<p>With all the steps done,I now have to hit Visual Studio.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>For all those who are wondering what this stars are,please go through my first <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/do-stars-count/">post</a> on this.</p>

<p>Casually browsing through my mails today morning,I found a mail with the subject stating,&lsquo;<em>Your online community contributions have been recognized by Microsoft</em>&rsquo;,informing me that I have won the Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoftcommunitycontributor.com/">Community Contributor Award</a>.Really excited to have the first award for a technical contribution,and that too from Microsoft.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mcca_rahulpnath.png" alt="Microsoft Community Contributor Award Certificate for Rahul P Nath" /></p>

<p>I appreciate Microsoft for promoting community contributors and rewarding them.Personally,I enjoy contributing in communities as I find it one another way to learn.I used not just reply to questions that I knew,but often ended up creating a sample application and finding out the solution first,which has helped me a lot in learning.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Microsoft and all the community members and people who would  have nominated me for this award.</p>

<p>Stars Do Count sometimes :)</p>

<p>edit: The award would be retired as now I am an Microsoft employee.I had intimated them on this ,as I guess somehow their records missed that I am their employee :).So got the mail confirmation today..award is retired .Still it&rsquo;s a good feeling in having achieved it at the first place.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/wcf-simplified/" itemprop="url">WCF Simplified </a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Windows Communication Foundation(WCF) is basically a framework that assists in building  service oriented applications.I really felt it to be complicated in the early days that I got exposed to it,and always tried to keep away from it.But the more I tried to keep away,the more closer I needed to be with it(not sure whether that would be another of Murphy&rsquo;s law).So finally got to sit with a book for couple of days and this is what I came out  with.</p>

<p><em>WCF is all about exposing CLR types as services and consuming services as CLR types</em></p>

<p>WCF brings together all the previous distributed programming models that were there, like ASMX,remoting,MSMQ making everyones life easier.You get the power of all previous technologies just by changing a set of configurations in a config file.The keywords in WCF is ABC which itself can be termed Endpoint.Endpoint is nothing but the A(Address),B(Binding) and C(Contract) put together.So now what is this ABC.(I would be relating this to you and explaining as you yourself is a &lsquo;service&rsquo;  in one way or the other.You provide a service to your family,friends,employer,government etc.)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong>ddress</li>
</ul>


<p>This is nothing but the address where your service would be located and would also tell the transportation mechanism that would be used like HTTP,TCP,Peer Network,IPC,MSMQ.With respect to,&lsquo;<em>you as a service</em>&rsquo;,this is exactly the address where one  can find you so that a consumer of your service can get the service that you provide.This can be your mail-id,phone number or house address,which also shows the mode of communication,depending on the kind of consumer that you are serving.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>B</strong>inding</li>
</ul>


<p>It is just a set of grouped combinations of transport protocol,encoding of the message ,security, reliability,transaction ,interoperability etc.Again with regards to &lsquo;<em>you as a service</em>&rsquo;,this can be seen as the langugae accent,how securely the information came on to you and things like that.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>C</strong>ontract</li>
</ul>


<p>This just specifies what the service does.This specifies what functionalities the service provides and also the way the data can be passed in and given out.With respect to <em>&lsquo;you as a service</em>&rsquo; this can be seen as the functionalities/activities that you do,the language in which that you can communicate(Say Engligh,French etc).Contracts in WCF are basically of 4 types,Service contract,Data contract,Fault contract and Message contract.Service contract specifies the set of functionalities that the service provides,Data contract specifies the way the data is exchanged,Fault contract specifies how faults/exceptions would be communicated out and Message contract specifies the format of  the message that is actually send(this is used very rarely,unless there is a specific structure that is to followed).Contracts aim at supporting interoperability and so it is to be expressed in a technology independent way.</p>

<p>Another key word that might come in between to confuse you more would be Channels.Now this is nothing but,something related to Binding.Since in a binding you specify different things like security,encoding and what not,each of these specific things are handled in its on layer/channel.You can see that there is something called Channel Stack,i.e. a stack of  different classes,each providing a discrete set of functionality.This whole stack would in turn make up your binding.Based on the you choose binding different channels would be stacked up together,just like you have different burgers with different layers of toppings :).As in burgers,you always have the option of making a custom binding too.</p>

<p>Any message that comes in to this channel stack,gets acted upon by different channels providing it/wrapping the message with security,reliability,transaction etc ,so that it comes out of the stack with all the features applied.So this takes away all the extra effort,that otherwise you would have had to do manually.This wrapping happens on the sending side and unwrapping happens on the receiving side.Because of this kind of architecture,WCF&rsquo;s architecture is also called &lsquo;<em>interception-based</em>&rsquo; architecture,as at each point it is intercepted and injected with additional features.</p>

<p>WCF has an extensible model.This means that at any place you can plugin your own custom implementations if required .<em><strong>System.ServiceModel</strong></em> is the one single namespace that turns life in the distributed world elegant and simple.So do explore it and start thinking everything around you as a service,so that you could relate things more to WCF :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Most of the people switching to WPF,got to understand the fact the WPF tries to target one major problem of the technologies that existed before, which was tight coupling of the design and the behaviour.WPF has a ‘<em>lookless control model</em>’,and that simply means that the look and feel of the control is completely separated from the behaviour of the  control.And that is where the whole concept of XAML comes in,which does its part of defining the visual representation.</p>

<p>But still many people move on to WPF from older technologies fail to absorb this core approach.Mostly this happens when the look of something is to be dynamically generated.Say in the case of a Listbox bound to a itemssource.As far as the item is to be displayed in pure text everything goes fine.People figure out that the <em>DisplayMemberPath</em> has to be set to the property that they want to be displayed in the listbox.
 &#8220;` csharp
 private void Window_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
          listBox1.ItemsSource = PopulateEmployees();
        }</p>

<pre><code>    private static List&lt;Employee&gt; PopulateEmployees()
    {
        List&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new List&lt;Employee&gt;();
        Employee emp;
        for int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        {
            emp = new Employee()
            {
                FirstName = "Name",
                LastName = i.ToString(),
                Id = i
            };
            employees.Add(emp);
        }
        return employees;
    }
}

class Employee
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

   public string LastName { get; set; }

    public int&lt;/span&gt; Id { get; set; }
}
```
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/binding_displaymemberpath.jpg" alt="binding displaymemberpath" /></p>

<p>But the scenario changes when the item to be displayed has to be more informative.Say you need a image to come up with some text,or maybe a button/checkbox etc.Now people tend to shift to the older approaches of creating the listbox items display from code.As that’s how it had been done before and also that seems easier.</p>

<p>The code changes to something similar to shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/binding_code_behind.jpg" alt="binding code behind" /></p>

<p>Or another approach might be slightly better than this one,by creating a user control to hold this data and then create the User control in the code behind and then add that to the listbox items.</p>

<p>This is where people tend to loose focus of the real power of WPF ..<strong>Templating</strong>.</p>

<p>All this code can be easily replaced and also clearly separate that UI details from the behaviour.The property that&rsquo;s the key here is <em>ItemTemplate,</em>and this would how the new code look like.</p>

<p><img src="/images/binding_data_template.jpg" alt="binding data template" /></p>

<p>And the code in the behind all vanishes,and is as simple in our first case,by just setting up the listbox1’s ItemsSource.</p>

<p>That is the power of templating and clearly separates the UI aspect from code. Any ItemsControl will have the property ItemTemplate that is to be set to the way you want the data to be displayed.If the display is complex in itself then you can move those into a separate user control and create  that user control  as the ItemTemplate.Anytime you want to change the way your control looks you just need to change in the xaml,clearly bringing in the decoupling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Every time one of my friends asks,&lsquo;<em>Hey how to start off with WPF</em>&rsquo;,I think of putting up a post,so that I could easily direct them and say,&lsquo;<em>Hey check out my post in my blog</em>&rsquo;.Maybe from the next time I would :)</p>

<p>There are a lot of blogs that describes on how to Kick start WPF,and this is my version of it.</p>

<p>WPF is just like any other technology that you would love to learn,except for the fact that not all technologies are cool..but WPF really is and you would enjoy every bit learning it.</p>

<p>Books would be the best source to kick start the learning,as the topics would be covered in a organized manner,so that you wouldn&rsquo;t need to hunt down the meaning of something new that you would come across.Some suggested books on WPF are</p>

<p>There are a lot of other books too that are good,but personally I found this as good for beginners.</p>

<p>Some of the must know things as far as WPF is concerned would be its Layout mechanism(Mathew&rsquo;s book gives a good explanation of that),Binding mechanism(Adams book should be good for that ).Also do understand the concept of Resources,Styles and Templates  if you would be playing the role of UX developer :).Otherwise also those are good to know concepts.</p>

<p>As with any technology developing a &lsquo;Hello World&rsquo; kind of application is easy.Its in about understanding the best practices,patterns that are best supported and implementing things the way they were actually meant to be.Same holds true for WPF too :)MVVM is one such pattern thats most talked about in WPF.There is a very good <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx/">article</a> by Josh Smith.There is also a book by him,Advanced MVVM,if you are interested in detail.Also do check out <a href="http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/">Prism </a>that is by the Microsoft P&amp;P team.It provides a very good guidance on how to go about developing applications.</p>

<p>You would also find lots of videos in <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/wpf">channel9</a>,which should also be a good source of information.</p>

<p>Blogs are another source of information,and lots of people seems to be in love with WPF,including me :)Almost all the major contributors to WPF are part of <a href="http://wpfdisciples.wordpress.com/">WPF disciples</a>,from which you can easily navigate to their respective blogs.</p>

<p>For anything else there is always the <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en/wpf/threads/">MSDN forum</a>,with people all round the world ready to answer your questions.Feel free to post any specific doubts that you come across.</p>

<p>Finally all reading and no implementing makes little use.So get a Visual Studio up and running and try things side by side..and soon you would find yourself good in WPF :)</p>

<p>Welcome to WPF :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>It&rsquo;s not been that long that I&rsquo;ve been into the IT servicing industry.But still the learning curve I&rsquo;ve had during the  past few years has been dramatic.The first time I was put into a &lsquo;<em>live client facing project</em>&rsquo; was almost one year after my industry entry.</p>

<p>Now what is the key takeaway from this post?</p>

<p>Nothing much maybe for a seasoned IT developer/professional.I am just trying to explain out what to look out for when developing an enterprise application as a beginner.How to approach things. Definitely its not like building an application that you might be used to creating during your college days(if at all you were ,coz I used not :) ).I was puzzled on where to start ,how to approach things,whats the right way.Here&rsquo;s what I figured out for my questions through my experiences.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the disclamer&hellip;.All views are just that of mine and only mine,just in case &hellip;.. :)</p>

<p>First thing I understood is there is nothing like &lsquo;<em>perfect resource</em>&rsquo; for a project.It&rsquo;s just that resources are molded to fit the requirement and the technologies.So you have to live with it and learn things the hard way.Try to get a view of things from a higher altitude,which means above technology.Try to understand the concept on which things are based on,rather than on how to use the particular implementation of a concept.For example a person working on .net should be flexible enough to move on to Java or any other OO(Object Oriented) language(this one is a personal experience again ).So trying to relate you learnings to OO concepts and seeing how it is implemented in .net would make you easily jump to a different language.Because you know what exactly to look out for there too.</p>

<p>On an implementation level,the process model that we had followed for the project,was waterfall,which by itself created a lot of problems on the requirement side.As the model advocates there was a big &lsquo;<em>upfront design</em>&rsquo; phase ,the output of which had very little resemblance to what came out in the end.But still it did exist with the key players being those like me,who were all just puzzled as I was,on what to do.Here I would like to mention the things that I felt towards the end of implementation,that I felt that I should have done during this phase.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Should have known/read of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> ,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)">GRASP</a> principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Awareness of certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)">design patterns</a> would have helped to create a better design.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Different approaches might be taken to tackle the same problem.But always make sure that the common cross cutting concerns are handled in a centralized manner.This includes things like exception handling,error logging,data validation,transaction and many other things.Handling this in a centralized manner makes things easier for you and targeting changes relating to any of these in an elegant,simple manner.The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc467894.aspx">Enterprise Library</a> is one such example which assists in the .net world.You could probably come up with your own frameworks.But always make sure you have,because I have learned this too..the hard way.</p>

<p>Refactoring,improving the design of the code after it has been written,is one process that any developer should start doing at his level,and better if implemented at a team level too.This really helps to remove &lsquo;smelly code&rsquo; and also improve your design.It&rsquo;s true that most developers switch job when they start hating ,see their own code &lsquo;<em>rot</em>&rsquo;.Recheck the disclaimer, if you don&rsquo;t agree.This can be avoided to some extent by refactoring I guess,An added advantage to refactoring maybe :)</p>

<p>Presentation layer/UI layer is the one part that people tend to develop a bit fast,because they want to see something of their own efforts.Make sure you have a architectural pattern targeting this like MVC,PM,MVP,MVVM etc.This is really important,again something  learnt the hard way.Don&rsquo;t just go ahead the &lsquo;<em>drag&#8217;n drop-double click-write code</em>&rsquo; way which is highly supported in Visual Studio(for .net) or any other IDE&rsquo;s.This seems easy to start with,but as time and code starts growing it becomes a pain.Make sure your logics are neatly separated and highly re-used.UI is one part where re usability comes down,and this is mostly because of the lack of proper use of architectural patterns as mentioned above.</p>

<p>Through my experiences,I learned that there is no such &lsquo;<em>one right way</em>&rsquo; of doing things,but its in how well you do things the way that you do matters.It&rsquo;s in how well you manage your dependencies that matter in the last,and thats what counts.Even now,having had an experience in a project,I am no good in this.Its just that I have learned some of the ways that things should not be done.</p>

<p>Some of the books that I found very helpful,though I have not read all cover-to-cover are :</p>

<ol>

<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Applying-UML-Patterns-Craig-Larman/dp/0137488807">Applying UML and Patterns</a> by Craig Larman</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Some of these books are technology specific,but most of them are not.Its just gives an approach to doing things,just using a technology as a medium of explaining.</p>

<p>Not sure whether this post would really target all audience,but if I had got to read some vague tips like this,the first time I face an enterprise project,it would have helped better,better in the sense,to make less mistakes maybe :)</p>
