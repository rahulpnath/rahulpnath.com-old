  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>It&rsquo;s not been that long that I&rsquo;ve been into the IT servicing industry.But still the learning curve I&rsquo;ve had during the  past few years has been dramatic.The first time I was put into a &lsquo;<em>live client facing project</em>&rsquo; was almost one year after my industry entry.</p>

<p>Now what is the key takeaway from this post?</p>

<p>Nothing much maybe for a seasoned IT developer/professional.I am just trying to explain out what to look out for when developing an enterprise application as a beginner.How to approach things. Definitely its not like building an application that you might be used to creating during your college days(if at all you were ,coz I used not :) ).I was puzzled on where to start ,how to approach things,whats the right way.Here&rsquo;s what I figured out for my questions through my experiences.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the disclamer&hellip;.All views are just that of mine and only mine,just in case &hellip;.. :)</p>

<p>First thing I understood is there is nothing like &lsquo;<em>perfect resource</em>&rsquo; for a project.It&rsquo;s just that resources are molded to fit the requirement and the technologies.So you have to live with it and learn things the hard way.Try to get a view of things from a higher altitude,which means above technology.Try to understand the concept on which things are based on,rather than on how to use the particular implementation of a concept.For example a person working on .net should be flexible enough to move on to Java or any other OO(Object Oriented) language(this one is a personal experience again ).So trying to relate you learnings to OO concepts and seeing how it is implemented in .net would make you easily jump to a different language.Because you know what exactly to look out for there too.</p>

<p>On an implementation level,the process model that we had followed for the project,was waterfall,which by itself created a lot of problems on the requirement side.As the model advocates there was a big &lsquo;<em>upfront design</em>&rsquo; phase ,the output of which had very little resemblance to what came out in the end.But still it did exist with the key players being those like me,who were all just puzzled as I was,on what to do.Here I would like to mention the things that I felt towards the end of implementation,that I felt that I should have done during this phase.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Should have known/read of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> ,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)">GRASP</a> principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Awareness of certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)">design patterns</a> would have helped to create a better design.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Different approaches might be taken to tackle the same problem.But always make sure that the common cross cutting concerns are handled in a centralized manner.This includes things like exception handling,error logging,data validation,transaction and many other things.Handling this in a centralized manner makes things easier for you and targeting changes relating to any of these in an elegant,simple manner.The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc467894.aspx">Enterprise Library</a> is one such example which assists in the .net world.You could probably come up with your own frameworks.But always make sure you have,because I have learned this too..the hard way.</p>

<p>Refactoring,improving the design of the code after it has been written,is one process that any developer should start doing at his level,and better if implemented at a team level too.This really helps to remove &lsquo;smelly code&rsquo; and also improve your design.It&rsquo;s true that most developers switch job when they start hating ,see their own code &lsquo;<em>rot</em>&rsquo;.Recheck the disclaimer, if you don&rsquo;t agree.This can be avoided to some extent by refactoring I guess,An added advantage to refactoring maybe :)</p>

<p>Presentation layer/UI layer is the one part that people tend to develop a bit fast,because they want to see something of their own efforts.Make sure you have a architectural pattern targeting this like MVC,PM,MVP,MVVM etc.This is really important,again something  learnt the hard way.Don&rsquo;t just go ahead the &lsquo;<em>drag&#8217;n drop-double click-write code</em>&rsquo; way which is highly supported in Visual Studio(for .net) or any other IDE&rsquo;s.This seems easy to start with,but as time and code starts growing it becomes a pain.Make sure your logics are neatly separated and highly re-used.UI is one part where re usability comes down,and this is mostly because of the lack of proper use of architectural patterns as mentioned above.</p>

<p>Through my experiences,I learned that there is no such &lsquo;<em>one right way</em>&rsquo; of doing things,but its in how well you do things the way that you do matters.It&rsquo;s in how well you manage your dependencies that matter in the last,and thats what counts.Even now,having had an experience in a project,I am no good in this.Its just that I have learned some of the ways that things should not be done.</p>

<p>Some of the books that I found very helpful,though I have not read all cover-to-cover are :</p>

</ol>


<p>Some of these books are technology specific,but most of them are not.Its just gives an approach to doing things,just using a technology as a medium of explaining.</p>

<p>Not sure whether this post would really target all audience,but if I had got to read some vague tips like this,the first time I face an enterprise project,it would have helped better,better in the sense,to make less mistakes maybe :)</p>

<p>Meantime got into a little bit of Expression blend,which would be an indispensable tool when working with WPF/Silverlight.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Just a though on a new mail attachment way :).</p>

<p>What if we could attach existing attachments in our mailbox to new mails that we want to send.Forwarding the mail that had the attachment might not be a good solution in many a cases.</p>

<p>The key point here is that attachments should be like a resource,that can be shared across mails,that can be deleted edited or updated.</p>

<p>There could be a small widget showing all attachments that you have in your mailbox,from which you can add whatever you want to your current mail.</p>

<p>I think this would be a cool feature in the present email system.</p>

<p>You would not end up uploading the same file again and again :)</p>

<p>Feel free to comment on this idea ::)</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/wp7-application-model/" itemprop="url">WP7 Application Model</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Mobile phones should be always responsive,highly responsive infact.If it&rsquo;s not responding within 10 to 15 seconds,the users hits the switch off button or removes the battery to reset the phone&hellip;.I have done this many a times.</p>

<p>The WP7 application model allows only 1 application to be running at a time.But its not that bad that you have to always start from the beginning of an app if you switch away from it.Whenever you switch away from an app,it just goes into a hibernation mode,tombstoning to be more precise.Whenever a user switches between applications,the phone activates and deactivates the applications.Events are raised to notify this activating and deactivating so that the developers can handle them and maintain the state of the application between switches,as if it was just back there running.A user may also explicitly close down an application by pressing the back button on the device at the first page of the application.</p>

<p>On start of a new instance of an application,which happens whenever an application is opened other than by switching to it using the back button,a launching event is raised after which the application moves on into the running state.It&#8217;s advised not to perform any time consuming activities in the Launching event handler,as any latency of more than 10 seconds causes the application to be bought down by the phone.So any IsolatedStorage access is recommended to be done after the application is up and running,making the app more responsive,which is our primary goal.On normal close the application raises a Closing event,where you might be saving persistent data to the IsolatedStorage.Data relating to a particular instance of application need not be saved here as the only way now to start the application is coming right from the beginning,raising the Launching even all over again.Again saving to the IsolatedStorage can be a little tricky.If it takes more than 10 seconds,the application will be terminated forcefully.The key here is that any data to be persisted should be done as and when you have the data and in a asynchronous manner.The earlier this happens the better it is for your application.Otherwise you may run into forceful termination of your application and loosing data and thereby decreasing you application&#8217;s reliability and use.</p>

<p>Tombstoning opens up a whole new path for the application lifecylcle,introducing additional two events,Activated and Deactivated.The State Dictionary maintained by the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.phone.shell.phoneapplicationservice(v=VS.92).aspx">PhoneApplicationService</a>(which also provides all the above mentioned events) is kept as is between application switches.That is whatever is saved in that before deactivating the app will be available after the application is activated.This is how maintaining application state is achieved between application switches.On start of a new application instance the State Dictionary would be empty.Data that is required for just a particular application instance goes into the State Dictionary and the data that is required for all application instances gets saved into the IsolatedStorage.Applications may get tombstoned due to many reasons.It maybe due to user hitting the start button when in an application,launching choosers or launchers(in some cases of doesn&rsquo;t get tombstoned,but its always better to handle for this),due to phone going into idle state(which again can be handled).</p>

<p>The below diagram,as from msdn, gives the complete picture of the application model.</p>

<p><img src="/images/wp7_application_model.png" alt="wp7 application model" /></p>

<p>Getting a good idea of the application model is important to build highly responsive,reliable application for the Windows Phone 7.</p>

<p>Not this post but&hellip;aaaahh&hellip;.procrastination!!!!!</p>

<p>No definitely not  (atleast to keep myself happy ;)).</p>

<p>But definitely the next post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Need not much of an explanation I guess.
The title has it all&hellip;.
&hellip;.a C# API for searching images from google.
Works on Regex for matching the image URL from the HTML returned for the image tag search.This might stop working anytime google changes the formatting.
Even the current regex is not returning all the images from a page.Working on that though..would be fixed in the next release<em>.
I started this to try the AsynEnumerator from <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/Resources/Downloads">PowerThreading </a>Library by Wintellect.
I guess i&rsquo;ve not understood it fully and there is an overuse of it in this version..that too would be looked into the next release</em>.</p>

<p>PS: Since the search results format is changing often the code might not work sometimes.Doing my best to keep it updated and working.Do check the comments too to see if the regex match string is changed.Sometimes I might not get time to update the solution,but would just leave a comment.Latest comment should be the best to match with :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Quite often in the client-server model,the requirement of getting notified of certain changes in the server pops up.Say for example in the movie ticket booking system.When a person selects a seat for booking,the selected seat should become disabled for all the users currently logged in,so that you can avoid the message &lsquo;Sorry the seat you were trying to book is already booked&rsquo;.<br/>
In such scenarios polling the server for changes might be one way to go about it.<br/>
Another way might be the server calling back to all the clients when a seat selection happens.<br/>
This post is about the second way and when the booking system is developed using WCF :)<br/>
The WCF framework provides a easy way to achieve this&hellip;..<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.servicecontractattribute.callbackcontract.aspx">Callbacks</a></p>

<p>The whole concept is simple.The server keeps track of all the active clients and knows how to call them when the required change happens in the server.<br/>
Again its all about certain interfaces that you have implement  and some attributes that you have to specify.<br/>
The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.servicecontractattribute.aspx">ServiceContract</a> that the client exposes also specifies the CallbackContract type.This is again another interface that the client needs to implement so that the server knows the type of client it is serving and can call back the functions on that interface.<br/>
This is much more like the eventing model.All functions in the CallbackContract would be like your event handlers,which would be invoked by the server on a particular event happening in the server.<br/>
You can go ahead and create a Publisher-Subscriber framework itself so that any future requirements of such nature would be easy to implement<br/>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163537.aspx#S6">This </a>article by Juval Lowy suggest a good way to implement a publisher-subscriber framework in WCF using callbacks.</p>

<p>The code provided below shows a quick example of Callbacks.Run minimum of two clients,so you get to understand what it is all about :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Introduce Foreign Method(<a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/introduceForeignMethod.html">IFM</a>) and Introduce Local Extension(<a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/introduceLocalExtension.html">ILE</a>) are two refactoring techniques that comes handy when you need to add functionality to an exisiting class,source code of which is beyond your control.
IFM is used when its just one or two functions that you need to add to the class.When the number of functions,that are to be added are more,then ILE is used.Not a rule though :)
But now with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977.aspx">Extension Methods</a> the whole process is much more simpler.
You need not do the subclassing or wrapper technique of ILE.
This can be a third way of implementing ILE :).Thanks to the framework team for keeping it simple.
The same date example using the &lsquo;Extension Methods&rsquo; way of refactoring</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The function NextDay is now available on any DateTime object,just as if you have written if you had access to the source code. It&rsquo;s the usage of ILE and IFM that has paved way for the inclusion of Extension Methods in the framework I guess.Thanks to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Fowler </a>for that.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Over the days I have been reading on Test Driven Development(TDD) and it seems really interesting methodology to go with as per development is concerned.<br/>
Basic of TDD is that the development process relies on &lsquo;tests&rsquo;, that are written prior to code.<br/>
Sounds astonishing!!!!<br/>
It might to someone into the normal development mode,where tests are usually written after code, so as to match the code that is written.<br/>
But TDD says just the opposite.<br/>
Code to make the tests pass&hellip;Just pass..<em>Nothing more and Nothing less</em>.<br/>
Thats where the catch is where most of we developers might find it difficult and needs getting used to.Not getting more into it as I would not be the best to comment on it :)<br/>
So whats refactoring got to do here.<br/>
Refactoring plays an integral part of TDD,so that the code is elegant and conveys just what it needs to,avoiding duplication.<br/>
The TDD approach also assists in refactoring as you have tests readily available to assure that the functional behaviour is not affected while changing the code design.You are just click of a button away if you are having a automated test scripts (like nUnit) in veryfying refactoring. <br/>
So both TDD and Refactoring goes hand in hand and helps in greatly improving the overall code quality.<br/>
There are quite a lot resources out there on these.<br/>
The best for refactoring would be of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201485672/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201485672&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-20">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=rahulpnath-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0201485672" alt="" />.<br/>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>It’s not uncommon to have problems in life, and so in the application/code that you write. I am not being too techie here.
It’s just I am relating my thoughts to something technical.
Being a software engineer, writing code is inevitable in my day-to-day life and so comes bugs :)
I spend  a lot of time sitting on to solve bugs(of late it’s been eating away  my head) and so do I see people  around me,  at my workplace, doing the same.</p>

<p>I always go in seek of the problem that caused the bug, rather than to find a solution for the bug.
Certain others go in seek of the solution for the bug, rather than the problem that caused the bug.
So am I not saying the same thing in two different ways….solving the bug!!!!
But they are not…at least for me :)</p>

<p>Seeking for the problem gives you the solution for the bug and also a better understanding of the code that you have written. You seek for the problem because  you feel the mistake is at your part, maybe a implementation one or a logical one.
Seeking for the solution too solves the bug but does  not give you  a better understanding of that you have done. Mostly the solution might be a workaround to cover up some of your own mistakes, which went unnoticed, as you were too concerned of the solution for the bug and not  the problem for the bug. This might really not solve the bug too, it might just be a temporary fix or a specific scenario fix.</p>

<p>This is just an example.
Same goes in the day to day life. Whenever you go in seek for solutions you are actually creating more problems for yourself.
Maybe a real life example(non technical :)) would do good.
Say you are a spendthrift and you keep spending away all what  you get.
Need money urgently?? Solution is to borrow from your friend. Does it really solve the problem??
Nope !! The problem here is that you are spendthrift. So try to change that and not keep borrowing :).</p>

<p>Don’t be happy with the solution, hunt down the  problem.
Happy hunting :)</p>
