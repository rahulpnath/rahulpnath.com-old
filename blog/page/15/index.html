  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>In our busy lives, with multiple roles to play at home and work, everyone needs to have some kind of system to keep things organized and stay on top - <strong><em>to have control</em>. </strong>I&rsquo;ve been always amazed on how my father stays organized with all the things with his to-do list paper calendar and the energy with which he gets things done. Apart from his not-so-optimized short trips on the two-wheeler(which he does because he enjoys it) in getting things done across the town, that is what I have always wanted to attain.</p>

<p>I have always tried the pen-paper method to keep track of things to get done, but somehow I could never keep up with it. I always lost track of it as most of my work is <strong>not <em>track able with paper</em></strong>. Most of my work is done using a computer and I thought something that best suites me would be some tool that is right in my computer. I have tried with a variety of tasks application and some of them are pretty good in how it organizes tasks. But again it yet did not integrate into my life that easily, as there was always an overhead of entering tasks.</p>

<blockquote><p>Contemplating over why all these systems itself was an overhead, one thing that I have realized that I was always trying to live two lives - <strong>personal and official</strong>, with these systems.</p></blockquote>

<p>Major part of my day is spend at office where work mostly comes over email. Keeping track of it on a different task list manager or paper is really an overhead. So mostly I ended my leaving my office tasks in my mails itself and only tried to manage my personal tasks on the tool. This is why I <em>was living two lives</em>. There were two systems of management(or even more as bugs are assigned in <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/tfs-overview-vs.aspx">Visual Studio TFS</a>) which by itself made tasks management an overhead and unmanageable.</p>

<p>After a  lot of reading and researching around the common productivity tools and systems finally I reached back to what I have been using day in and day out – <strong><em>Outlook. </em></strong>Outlook is more than a mere mailbox management tool. It has a lot of features that is built into it which is seldom used and overlooked upon. One advantage with outlook is that it is available everywhere – desktop, web, tablet and phone.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/Outlook_folders_productivity.png" alt="Outlook_folders_productivity" /></p>

<p>Most of us, even me used to just use flags on messages to indicate the messages that I had to take actions on. But this would soon turn out unmanageable, as it is hard to prioritize out from a single large list. Outlook has an important feature of <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/outlook-help/create-and-assign-color-categories-HA010217901.aspx">categorization</a> and also <a href="http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/bb899478.aspx">folderization</a>. Either of this feature can be used to maximize the way in which we manage tasks.</p>

<p>I have chosen to use folders for the only reason that it is easier to sync folders on to my mobile, than categorized tasks, for which I would again need another application. As mentioned in the <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0142000280/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=0142000280&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21">Getting Things Done</a>, by David Allen I have created various folders to categorize the tasks that come in</p>

<p><strong>.NextActions:</strong>  This holds the immediate next actions that I need to do. I further set a <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/outlook-help/flag-an-item-for-follow-up-HA010355003.aspx">flag date</a> to further prioritize them within the list.
<strong>.WaitingFor: </strong>This holds the items that I am waiting for somebody else to reply or something that I have delegated to someone else for action.(This is probably a NextAction on some one else’s list)
<strong>.TalkTo: </strong>These are things that I need to talk to people in person or over phone.
<strong>.References: </strong>These are reference documents that would be useful.
<strong>@Future: </strong>This contains tasks that needs to be done in the future, which might be in the next week. This would soon go into the .NextActions.
<strong>@Blog: </strong>These contain activities I need to do maintain this blog</p>

<p>And many of such folders that makes sense to me. You should create folders that makes sense to you.So all my official and personal tasks are now managed in my mailbox. For any tasks that do not come over a mail, I send a mail to myself.</p>

<p><strong>Reaching Zero Inbox</strong></p>

<p>Having a <a href="http://inboxzero.com/">zero mail inbox</a> is a very important thing – but not at any given point of time. Mails definitely can wait some time, before you take action on them. Allocate time to check mails and try to follow it. Once you check mails allocate them into the various folders that you already have. If it is something that you can answer to in less than a few minutes then do that immediately than allocating them to a folder and then picking it up from there. For anything else allocate them to different folders and act upon them later as per their priority. Create calendar entries/reminders only if it is strictly time bound, which has to happen at a specific time or date, like birthdays, booking time etc.</p>

<p>Create meaningful <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/outlook-help/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-HA010355682.aspx">mail rules</a> so that you get to see what is urgent/important first. You need not scan all mail rule folders at all times. Mails that directly are addressed to you, mostly would need your attention. So the first rule would be to have messages that are directly addressed to you, to come to your inbox. Messages that you are <em>cc’ed</em>  in are mostly for information and should go to a different folder(Inbox-cc). But there are high chances that people who send messages  to you might not take a good look on when replying to messages in which field you are in. I have seen this, where it was directly addressed to me in the subject, but was cc’ed. But at least make sure you do not make this mistake. Always check the to and cc fields before sending/replying to mail. All other mails that reached me because I am in certain distribution lists goes into specific folders, which I scan only once a day.</p>

<p>Create a mail scanning process for yourself, whatever works for you. But try to stick to it.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Attention</strong></p>

<p>The biggest thing for staying productive and organized is attention management than time management. Even if you have scheduled your time for tasks, if you don&rsquo;t have the attention required then there is no point in managing your time. It is easy to manage your attention. Find things that distracts you and try to avoid them. One of the main thing in today&rsquo;s world that distracts us the most is – <strong>push notifications</strong>. Turn them off.Yes your heard it right. Turn them off right now. There is nothing that important coming over those notifications that is more important than keeping your attention to what you want. Notifications should be only for phone calls if you feel them important, because I do. I keep my internet turned on, as I would still want to have emails, tweets or other updates to be still updated onto my phone when I need them.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Turn off  Push Notifications</strong>. This is really going to help you manage your attention.</p></blockquote>

<p>Try to forcefully keep your attention to the task at hand. You can try out <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">The Pomodoro Technique</a>. There are many apps for the phone that will work as a timer for the technique. I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.phlam.android.clockworktomato&amp;hl=en">Clockwork Tomato</a> - Yes for some time I am on an android Nexus5.</p>

<p>Plan your day so that you have a goal to achieve everyday, that just reacting to mails and working on someone else’s priorities. Don’t start your checking mails in the morning immediately after getting up. Have fixed times for checking mails, but definitely not the first thing in the morning.It might be hard for couple of days but it is only a matter of getting used to. You will definitely see a difference once you start following it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Stop checking your mails the first thing in the morning immediately after getting up.</p></blockquote>

<p>Its not been long since I have started to follow this, but I felt interesting enough to share this if it helps someone who is also searching for tools and methodologies to keep yourself productive and manage your tasks and responsibilities. There are a lot of resources that has inspired into this process and would be wrong to not mention it here</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>We had seen on how <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/windows-phone-series-incremental-loading/">incremental loading can be done in a Windows phone</a>, so that data can be fetched as user scrolls down the available data. This is important for data sources that have a large amount of data and when all of these cannot be loaded at once. I have been getting queries on how to implement this for a Pivot control ,in which each pivot item would bind with multiple data sources or endpoints.</p>

<p>An ideal example for this would be the <a href="http://developers.500px.com/">500px api</a>, where we have photos categorized into different streams and each one of them can be in a pivot item. Since we have been talking about <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/tag/mvvm/">mvvm</a>, all along will implement this using MVVM.</p>

<p><img src="/images/WP_IncrementalLoading.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>In the sample application here, I have created 2 projects – PCL and Windows Phone project, just for showing the code separation that can be achieved using MVVM. The PCL can be reused with Windows 8 too to develop a similar application, with a few minor tweaks. We would see how we can incrementally load each of these pivot items as and when the user scrolls down on the list of photos.</p>

<p>In the MainViewModel, we create ViewModel’s for each of the PivotItem, which are instances of PhotoCollectionViewModel. Each of these PhotoCollectionViewModel represents a photo stream of 500px, which is defined as a static collection of string. You can add on to this the other streams available in the 500px api to have them displayed too.</p>

<p>In the PhotoCollectionViewModel, we create the url from which the data needs to be  fetched from the api, along with the api consumer key, which can be obtained by <a href="http://500px.com/settings/applications">registering an application here</a> and assign the url to a IncrementalLoader, that will take care of incrementally loading the data and returning it to the ViewModel. The url has a placeholder for the current page number(<strong><em>page={0}</em></strong>) that would be populated by the IncrementalLoader on each load.</p>

<p>The IncrementalLoader is a generic class that takes in url from which it has to load the data and returns the generic type that it is assigned to on each LoadNextPage request.</p>

<p>In the ItemRealized method of the LongListSelector, we decide on whether to load the next page of data or not, based on the current item that gets realized. We load the data if the item realized is third from the last in the current list of photos.We connect the ItemRealized method to the ViewModel code in the code behind.</p>

<p>Whenver a user scrolls on a pivot the corresponding, ItemRealized methods gets called from which we call on to the load the data for that PhotoCollectionViewModel. This way each of the pivots are incrementally loaded as required.</p>

<p>The code for this is available <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/IncrementalLoading">here</a>. Make sure you register for an application in the 500px api portal to get a consumer key that needs be updated in the solution for it to run.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>One of the main things that makes enterprise or intranet applications more lively and connected with your business contacts, is to integrate with <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/lync/">Lync</a> (formerly Microsoft Office Communicator) and provide options to interact with them. UCWA(Unified Communications Web Api) is a REST API that exposes Lync Server and its presence capabilities, which can be used to enhance your application capabilities. This can also be used to integrate with Windows phone applications as well and will see how to get started with it here.</p>

<p>To connect to a lync server the only details that we would want is the full email address and the password – thanks to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj900169(v=exchg.150">AutoDiscover</a>.aspx) for exchange, which makes this possible. AutoDiscover is the way to find the users home server so that we can connect to it. The url for auto discover, otherwise called the <a href="https://ucwa.lync.com/documentation/GettingStarted-RootURL">Root Url</a> can take different forms. In this sample I have assumed that it would take the below form, primarily because it works with the test domain that I was using (microsoft.com).</p>

<p>Creating a UCWA application is the starting point for every app that needs to work with UCWA.  The following steps indicated in the below diagram are to be followed to create an application.

<p>Issuing a get request to ‘<a href="https://lyncdiscover.microsoft.com/">https://lyncdiscover.microsoft.com/</a>’, will give the details of the home server that we need to connect to.</p>

<p>We now need to authenticate the user with the home server.for which we need the oauth url. This can be obtained by issuing a dummy get request to the <em>user </em>url obtained above. This request will fail with an unauthorized access but also returns the url (<a href="https://lync32.lyncweb.microsoft.com/WebTicket/oauthtoken">https://lync32.lyncweb.microsoft.com/WebTicket/oauthtoken</a>) from which the token needs to be obtained</p>

<p>UCWA supports Windows Authentication, Anonymous meeting and Password Authentication mechanisms to authorize the user. i am using the Password Authentication here. On successful authentication a token is returned which can be used to issue the get request on the <em>user </em>url with the token in the header.</p>

<p>A successful request for the above returns the applications url. The applications url might be hosted on a different server in which case we would need to get a separate token for creating a new application. The host of applications url and the oauth url we got above should be same , or else we need to get a new token. When creating a new application, we add the token only if the host’s are same. Not adding this will again fail with Unauthorized exception giving us the new oauth url.</p>

<p>Once this is done we have successfully created an application, that can be used to do a lot more things. As for the sample I have just retrieved the user’s full name, department and title that comes as part of successfully creating an application. You can do a lot more like getting the users presence, image, contacts, join meetings and a <a href="https://ucwa.lync.com/documentation/core-features">lot more</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ucwa_wp_login.png" alt="image" /><img src="/images/ucwa_wp_loggedIn_details.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>You can find the sample <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/UCWA.WindowsPhone">here</a>.Hope this helps you to build connected enterprise applications.</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: I have tested this only against <strong>microsoft.com</strong> domain. In case you find any issues with the domain that you are using please do put it in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>We had looked into many of the common MVVM scenarios, that we come across while developing windows phone applications in <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/mvvm-a-windows-phone-scenario/">MVVM – A Windows Phone Scenario.</a> We will see some more that we were left off, in this post.</p>

<p><strong>5. Page Navigations and Parameters</strong></p>

<p>For almost all the application, we would need to transfer the control from one page to another, so that the user can navigate through the various contents on the application. In a MVVM application, these navigations would be basically triggered from the ViewModel, as it is there where we need to know where the next control should go to.
Navigation is basically a platform specific feature and we would not want to bring in any dependency between a platform specific feature and our ViewModels. So the best way here is to <em>inverse the dependency</em>, using an interface and inject the dependency via an IoC container. Will call the interface here as <em>INavigationService </em>as given below, and the implementation <em>NavigationService</em>.</p>

<p>This is just a sample implementation that you can use. The <em>DispatcherHelper </em>used here is from MVVMLight, which needs to be initialized when the application starts. This can be in the App.xaml.cs in the application constructor</p>

<p>Here in the above example the parameters are considered to be primitive data-types, which is why it is added as query parameters to the navigation uri. In case you want to have complex parameters passed between pages, you could have a property on the INavigationService, which can be set when calling the Naivgate method. This values can be retrieved when the OnNavigatedTo in the ViewModel.</p>

<p>The NavigationService needs to be registered with the MVVM IoC in ViewModelLocator (or anywhere else), and then you could either constructor inject it or create an instance in the BaseViewModel class, so that all ViewModels has a reference to this for navigation.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="n">SimpleIoc</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Default</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Register</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">INavigationService</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NavigationService</span><span class="p">&gt;();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When developing applications for both Windows phone and Windows 8 or x-platform, your ViewModels would remain the same and the NavigationService implementations only would change, and would be accordingly injected into the IoC, when the application starts. So for any platform specific features/dependencies this would be the approach that you would need to choose to minimize the dependencies for your ViewModel. Other cases that I can think of right now is for Push Notifications, where each platform would have their own implementations for registering and raising notifications. So you would use the same approach to <em>inverse the dependencies.</em></p>

<p><strong>6. Page Events</strong></p>

<p>Most of the processing/data loading work in done usually on the OnNavigatedTo of the page. To hook to this event in the ViewModel, we would go ahead and introduce some base classes so that we can reuse this in all over ViewModels. We have a application specific base class for the PhoneApplicationPage. We override the <em>OnNavigatedTo</em> event here and call on to the application specific base ViewModel’s OnNavigatedTo event. For any ViewModel to hook into this event just needs to override this method on the ViewModel, as shown in the sample below</p>

<p>Similarly for any of the other page events also you could create it in the page base class and call the corresponding function on the ViewModel base.</p>

<p><strong>7. Application Bar</strong></p>

<p>I have already put out a detailed post on how to implement an application bar using MVVM. It details out 2 approaches one using Messenger and another having the applciation bar as a service. Check it out at  - <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/windows-phone-series-mvvm-and-applicationbar/">Windows Phone Series – MVVM and ApplicationBar</a></p>

<p>We have seen most of the basic scenarios that we normally come across while developing an application for windows phone and on how MVVM can be applied to that, so that we can make the best out of it. With lots of devices getting out there and having the need to have your application on all platform demands the maximum reuse, so that you can be out there quickly. MVVM plays a very important role in structuring your code making this possible. Even while developing cross platform application using <a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a>, MVVM can be used to advantage so that all the application logic is neatly abstracted away from UI.</p>

<p>Do comment in on any of the missed scenarios that you normally come across while developing applications for the Windows platform.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>If you are a programmer and don’t have a blog, then there is no better time than now to start one. <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/HanselminutesOn9/Hanselminutes-on-9-Social-Networking-for-Developers-Part-1-Every-Developer-Needs-a-Blog">Every developer should have a blog</a>, for a very simple reason – <strong>Otherwise all your work is just going wasted!.</strong> I can bet that the best of your code or ideas would either be in some old email that you hardly have access to or archived or in some backup hard-disk waiting to be formatted or already formatted and all gone. All the thought, research and creativity that you would have spent would be lying just wasted and with little or no use. Having an online presence has really become a necessity in today&rsquo;s connected world, and a blog is the best place to show your presence. I started off answering <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/stars-do-count/">mdsn forums</a> and then figured that most of the people had similar questions and I was giving the same answers many a times, which gave me the thought of blogging answers and posting links to them. So anytime someone asks you something or you do something awesome blog it, so that your work does not get wasted and more people would find it useful. As with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming">rule of three</a>) for refactoring, with blogging it’s just rule of one – <em><strong>blog it always </strong>(</em>even this blog is because some one asked me after I recently moved on to a self hosted blog<em>).</em>
I have had a taste of blogspot and WordPress blog web hosting service,  before moving on to a self-hosted blog here. I think you would have guessed which one I would suggest you to get if you are starting your blog – a self hosted one. Indeed there is some effort that goes in to maintain the blog, but its worth every effort that you put.</p>

<p>I use WordPress as the blogging software and am running it on a Linux server (had to change over from windows, as there were a lot of compatibility issues that I faced). WordPress is a very popular blogging engine and so has an immense collection of themes, plug-in and add-on that are available to enhance yours and your readers experience. Once you get your wordpress installed on your self hosted domain, which should be as easy as clicking a button, install the below plugin’s.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first thing would be to <strong>connect with </strong><a href="http://jetpack.me/"><strong>jetpack</strong></a>. This would give you a lot of features including stats, social integration, publicize options and many more.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect with <a href="http://akismet.com/"><strong>akismet</strong></a> using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">plug-in</a> for preventing/moderating spam comments. Akismet provides a free subscription for personal users.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://feedburner.google.com/"><strong>Claim your feed</strong></a> and put it on your blog. You can again use a <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/feedburner-form/">feedburner-form</a> if you want.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate with<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"><strong>Google analytics</strong></a>, if you want more detailed statistics than the one provided with jetpack. Once you get your code, you can use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/googleanalytics/">plug-in</a> to integrate with your site. This will add the necessary code in all your pages header.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you have a <strong>backup plan</strong>, as you would not want all your data to vanish off if something happens with the hosting server. You could either use vaultpress or use freely available plug-in to back up to popular cloud storage like Dropbox, Skydrive or Google drive.</p></li>
<li><p>Get a <strong>good theme</strong> for your blog, there a lot of free and paid ones out there.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now that you have most of the things setup, it’s time for you to put up your first page, <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/about/">About me</a>. This is very important as it gives a sense of credibility to your readers, so make sure you have one. For creating content on to your blog, you can either use the online editor or use some offline editor. Personally I use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=8621">Windows live writer</a>. I love using this and all my blogs are written using this. The one plug-in that you would want to get, if you are a developer is <a href="http://precode.codeplex.com/">PreCode</a>, which makes inserting code really easy.
There are a lot more things that your blog would need, you would soon find that out and when you do, please leave a note of it in the comments section below. Happy Blogging!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Couple of people were asking about getting started with a free blog. <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> or <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> would be a very good option to start with. Personally I used Wordpress as I felt that better. The advantage with tumblr over wordpress is that you can <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_domains">link your custom domain name with tumblr for free</a> while <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/map-existing-domain/">worpress charges for linking a custom domain</a>. (You would need to pay for the custom domain in either cases). But then I ended up hosting all myself after moving away from Wordpress.com.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><blockquote><p>“<em>If you want to learn to do something you must figure out how you would do it yourself  </em>”.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not something that one would want to hear when setting out to learn something new. But I think this is very true whenever you set out to learn something new, it is finally about finding your way, our way rather <strong>my way</strong> <strong>of doing things.</strong></p>

<p>I used to be amazed by most of the photos that&rsquo;s floating around in the social and photography sites. I wondered how people could take these pictures and thought it was some art that one has to be born with. But soon I started seeing lots of my friends too putting up awesome shots of their trips or their neighborhoods. For most of the photos one thing was common, <strong><em>a DSLR.</em></strong></p>

<p>I got myself a <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B007O6HQZ0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24790&amp;creativeASIN=B007O6HQZ0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21">Canon EOS 550D</a> along with the basic 18-55mm kit lens thinking that was the answer to all the wonderful photos that I wanted to take.  But only to find that my pictures were blurry, out of focus, lacking contrast  and sharpness and mostly no subject at all. I never found life in my photos, which made me believe that I ‘<em>lacked that inborn talent</em>’.
But I didn&rsquo;t want to give up that fast. I started reading, reading a lot on these figuring out what people did, I started talking to my friends whose photos I liked , watching video tutorials and last but not the least, started clicking a lot. As a beginner to dslr photography the learning curve is very high, but not hard. In this post I just want to put out those things that helped me to improve on my photography skills at least to a point where I don&rsquo;t regret shelling out the money to get this awesome equipment.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong> Read the manual:</strong> Knowing the equipment is the only way you can use it your benefit, so the very first thing to make sure is to know your camera and its controls well. It would really pay off to take up that manual you left off in the camera packaged box and start reading. If you don&rsquo;t like the way the manual is put out get a book that explains your camera., for me it was <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B003NX731K/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24790&amp;creativeASIN=B003NX731K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21">Canon EOS Rebel T2i / 550D For Dummies</a>. There would be one for your camera too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Know the basics: </strong>One of the most popular mistakes we make as a beginner is to not hold the camera properly. <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-hold-a-digital-camera">Learn how to hold the camera properly</a> and practice it over and over again. Learn about <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/aperture">aperture</a>, <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/using-focal-points-in-photography">focal points</a>, focal length, <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed">shutter speed</a>, <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings">iso</a> and <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance">white balance</a>. These are not rocket science and something that we all would have learned in our physics classes. Just try to read through it over and over again, until have a fairly good idea. Remember to give it some time to get into you and don’t hurry into anything. Read through different articles on the internet and watch some videos in YouTube to get a better understanding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learn the rules: </strong>I was not the guy with that inborn talent, so had to learn how to compose. Composition simply means  choosing what to include and what to exclude from your photos. In addition to that there are also some simple techniques that one can use to improve your composition. <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds">Rule of thirds</a> is the first rule that you want to start using, and also <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/digital-photography-composition-tips">a lot more</a> like diagonal lines, frames, geometric shapes and much more. But also do learn on how to break the rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Choose your gear: </strong>Most of us start of with a entry level dslr camera with the kit lens, which is good enough for a beginner. Its better to understand the equipment properly and also your tastes in photography before investing more on costlier lenses. Once you have got the hang of it, then you would figure out what you want all by yourself. You would know what is limiting you and what you really want. But to start with you should have a DSLR, a tripod and a camera bag. When you invest on a tripod make sure you don&rsquo;t go cheap on it. A tripod is really a worthy investment and a good one will last you a long time. I made the mistake of getting a <a href="http://www.linkdelight.com/PK034-YUNTENG-VCT-668-Pro-Tripod-with-Damping-Head-f-SLR-Canon-Nikon.html">cheap one</a> first but soon had to spent on a new one which is a Manfrotto with ball head. I found that the pan head tripod was very hard to use and position. It took me for ever on my first tripod to move all these knobs up and down on the pan head, to position for my shot. I liked the ball head ans it was super fast and easy to position for any shot. You should <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW_mb2yNm9Y">check out for yourself</a> with different models before getting one. Also get a decent bag that can carry your dslr and tripod along. Have in mind the possible lens updates that you would make before buying on a bag, so that you don&rsquo;t end up having to buy a new one when you have more lenses. I chose a <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/2013/01/05/what-made-me-choose-vanguard-up-rise-45/">Vanguard Uprise 45 and here&rsquo;s why</a>.This is what is in my <a href="http://www.digitalrev.com/rahulpnath/bag">bag</a> now.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shoot in RAW: </strong>DSLR has this capability of shooting in jpeg&rsquo;s like most of the other digital camera&rsquo;s out there. But what really makes it apart is its capability to shoot RAW. You are never going to make the difference unless you switch to shooting in RAW. Now you might think what is big thing it is just about a change in settings. But that small change is gonna take you a long way in photography and make that difference in the pictures that you click. When you shoot in jpeg, what happens is the camera does some built in algorithm to optimize the photos that you take, to apply the contrast, sharpness, balance and what not. But it might not always make the right choice. Especially you might have your white balance off and the colors might appear totally different. Unless you are doing product photography you would not have to worry what the exact white balance is. You could always choose your white balance after the shot in a post production software. A lot more advantages are there while shooting in <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg">RAW vs JPEG</a>. I always shoot in Raw + Jpeg mode in my canon, just in case if I want to quickly select some images. Also it might be worthy to compare how better you are doing shooting in RAW by comparing it with a JPEG shot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Post Processing: </strong>Shooting in RAW is never complete without talking about post production. With the RAW format it is just like you have an image which does not have any contrast, sharpness, clarity, saturation etc applied by your camera. You need to apply that all yourself using a post production software. Before shooting in RAW I used to use <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a>, to edit my photos mostly to boost up the saturation and increase the clarity. But after moving on to RAW I have figured out that you ought to have better software for editing/post processing. The unanimous choice for all would be <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=106&amp;platform=Windows">Adobe Camera Raw</a> . If you have <a href="http://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop-lightroom.html">Adobe Lightroom</a> it&rsquo;s even better, it is simple camera raw plus a whole lot of other features. And if you have <a href="http://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop</a> even better. At the very least you should get Camera Raw.
<strong> ‘</strong>Ahh!! that is photoshopped’. This is a very popular thing that you come across in photography. Using Photoshop/other post-processing tools is not a crime. It is just like you modifying the image properties yourself than having the camera&rsquo;s pre-written algorithm do that. So you are never avoiding processing, Even  when shooting JPEG your camera is doing the processing for you and here you are doing it for yourself. Some people might say the sky never was like that on that day, come&#8217;on you have faked it. But who cares, there is no international committee that says the sky&rsquo;s color should be #XYZ. It&rsquo;s all how you want it to be and how you want your viewers to see it. So if they are liking it, you are liking it then who cares what the color was that day. If you don&rsquo;t want to try out different color, don&rsquo;t do that too. Keep it the way it was that day.
I was always overwhelmed whenever I opened camera-raw/lightroom/photoshop. There are innumerous controls that I think rarely anyone would know end to end(Scott Kelby might know, he has got some excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00DZP3KJ0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24790&amp;creativeASIN=B00DZP3KJ0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21">books</a>. There is just a very few set of controls that you would be using always and that you would have to know 90% of the time. So invest your time in understanding them. Check below for some good resources that would help you get started, it really did help me.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Listen to the experts: </strong>More than books I have felt that video’s convey a bit more while learning about photography. Some of the popular people I like to watch are <a href="http://www.karltaylorphotography.com/">Karl Taylor</a> and <a href="http://scottkelby.com/">Scott Kelby</a>. There a lot of good resources on YouTube that would help. I have created a playlist of my favorite videos, that has helped me a lot with photography. These include post processing, shooting techniques, composition and a lot more. The videos are in order of how much it helped me, though it might not be the same for you.</p>

<p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL59L9XrzUa-kVwizZ_pRmMOD4y0mrKAtd" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></p>

<p> Apart from the videos in the playlist I have also found the videos by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/photoexposed">Mike Browne</a> very helpful in understanding the basics on camera and its functionality and also on composition. <a href="http://kelbytraining.com/">Kelby Training</a> also has a very good set of resource that you are sure to enjoy.
 There is a lot more to learn from good photographers. Try to take a look at their work and see what makes you to love those photos. See what is your area of interest and try to work towards that. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">500px</a> has an amazing collection of awesome photos. &lsquo; <em>The more pictures you see the better you are as a photographer </em>&rsquo;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Share for Feedback: </strong>You should share the pictures that you take with others, family friends or general public. By doing this you are sure to get a lot of feedback and inputs on how you click. Today there is no dearth for the options that you have got to share your photos. Some of the popular ones are <a href="http://500px.com/">500px</a> , <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> , Facebook etc.  Try to join a photography club near you and go for photo-walks or sharing your pictures with them as you would get more feedback from like minded people. Analyse your shots yourself and see what can be improved, what went good and what went wrong. It will really help you the next time you shoot. Try to reproduce shots that you have seen and liked, that will definitely take you through a whole new learning journey.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Learning photography seems like a long journey, but this has only put me into the beginner seat and there is a lot more to go. Nevertheless this is an amazing experience and have loved every bit of it. It has opened a whole new me in myself as I see things in different view. Soon you learn to see things through a rectangle frame even without having one. It makes you enjoy the things around you and appreciate nature more. The best places to start clicking without having anyone stare at you are at some parks or zoo&rsquo;s near you. You would have all the time in the world to you and can try out all the tricks that you would have read and learned. Always make sure you click the people who travel with you, so that you keep them happy too!</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/converting-a-pdf-for-your-kindle/" itemprop="url">Converting a PDF for your Kindle</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Earlier I had blogged about reading an <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/2009/09/14/ebook-or-hard-copy/">eBook vs reading a hard copy</a> and I was preferring the hard copy one back then. But after getting a <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B007HCFU90/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24790&amp;creativeASIN=B007HCFU90&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21">Kindle</a> things have changed. I prefer MOBI now, as that is the one that is supported by Kindle. I think a Kindle needs no introduction and the only thing I can say about it is “<em>If you don’t own one, get one.</em>  The e-ink display is a real comfort for the eye and it just feels like reading from paper.“ I got the most basic version of Kindle and I am happy with that(at least for now).</p>

<p>The easiest way to get books on your Kindle is to buy them from Amazon, right from your Kindle itself. The experience is so seamless that you just cannot resist from. But often you have pdf’s with you that you would want to read in your Kindle. There are a couple of ways(in fact a lot more), that you can get your pdf to the Kindle.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong> </strong>The most direct and easy way is to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/email">send it to your kindle mail address</a>.  The problem with this is it that it makes the font very small that it is difficult to read.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also a lot of tools that help you manage your eBooks that have kindle support too. <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> is one such popular tool. Calibre has options to send to Kindle, which would convert pdf to the required mobi format. The problem with this is that it keeps inserting line breaks after every other line.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So with the both the methods I have found that the formatting gets all messed up for the Kindle, making it difficult to have a smooth reading. After a lot of investigating , I have come up with a good method to get my pdf onto the Kindle.</p>

<p>It is a simple <strong><em>3 step</em></strong> process:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>

<p>Convert the pdf into html with <a href="http://www.mobipocket.com/en/downloadsoft/productdetailscreator.asp">mobipocket creator</a>.  Highlighted in yellow below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mobicreator.png" alt="mobi creator" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>

<p>From the above step you would get a html output file. Import this converted html format into <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a></p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>

<p>Right click on the imported html file in Calibre. Select the option to Convert into mobi and transfer it to your Kindle.
Here is a comparison of the all the 3 methods above in order(kindle email, direct calibre and mobicreator + calibre )</p>

<p><img src="/images/kindle_email.jpg" alt="kindle email" /><img src="/images/Kindle_Caliber.png" alt="Kindle Caliber" /><img src="/images/kindle_mobicreator_caliber.png" alt="Kindle mobicreator caliber" /></p>

<p>You can clearly see that last image above is well formatted and matches almost to our original pdf.</p>

<p>This might not be the best way always but most of the time it has got me well formatted books on my Kindle. Please chip in with any better ways in the comments section.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/windows-phone-series-jump-lists/" itemprop="url">Windows Phone Series – Jump Lists</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>One of the best things about the windows phone is that way you can navigate large lists of data.  Jumplist provides an easy and fast way to navigate large data, just like we do in the contacts hub or the apps collection. It would be great to have this behaviour even in the apps that we develop so that we can give a consistent experience to our application users.
Jumplist can be implemented using LongListSelector, which is part of the <a href="http://phone.codeplex.com/">Windows Phone toolkit</a> for Windows phone 7. With Windows Phone 8 this is included along with the sdk. Implementing jump list with the longlistselector is easy enough, that you can get this into your application in a few minutes. Lets see how.
If you are already using a listbox then you should be changing it to a longlistselector or if you are already using that, then you might be using it in the “ungrouped mode”, by setting IsFlatList=”True”. Change this to False.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;toolkit:LongListSelector</span> <span class="na">Name=</span><span class="s">&quot;allPersons&quot;</span> <span class="na">IsFlatList=</span><span class="s">&quot;False&quot;</span> <span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/toolkit:LongListSelector&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We need to specify a few templates for the date to be rendered to our needs as shown below. In this example we would be looking at a contacts sample.</p>

<p><img src="/images/wp_jumplist_items.png" alt="windows_phone_jumplist_items" /><img src="/images/wp_jumplist_groups.png" alt="windows_phone_jumplist_groups" /></p>

<p><strong>ItemTemplate</strong></p>

<p>The itemtemplate specifies how the bound list of items should be displayed. This would be the same as that you have been using earlier for your listbox.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/toolkit:LongListSelector.ItemTemplate&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>GroupHeaderTemplate</strong></p>

<p>The groupheadertemplate specifies the template for each header of the group.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/toolkit:LongListSelector.GroupHeaderTemplate&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>GroupItemTemplate</strong></p>

<p>The groupitemtemplate specifies the template for the headers, when in group view mode. This is the display that would be presented when we are to choose a group to navigate to.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>GroupItemsPanel</strong></p>

<p>The groupitemspanel specifies the panel to be used to display the groupitems. If we are using only alphabets as the group headers, then we would want to wrap each of these items. If our group items are long enough then it would be better to leave it as default which would be a stackpanel.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>We need to group the data that gets bound to the list. For a normal listbox you would either bind a List or an ObservableCollection. In this we would need to group the data that gets bound to the control as groups that we want to display. In this example our data is a list of Persons, and we would want to group the data with their starting character. If the starting character is an alphabet, then we would display that person under that character. For any non-alphabet we would group it under ‘#’. The GroupedPersons in our DataRepository would return the data for us.</p>

<p>To get all the characters from A-Z we use the below code, after which it is some simple logics, that would is self explanatory</p>

<pre><code class="csharp"> char[] az = Enumerable.Range('a', 26).Select(a =&gt; (char)a).ToArray();
</code></pre>

<p>This should now have made your flat list into a easily navigable jump list, that your users would love to use and make it easier for them to use you application.</p>

<p>You can find the code for this sample <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/JumpList">here</a></p>
