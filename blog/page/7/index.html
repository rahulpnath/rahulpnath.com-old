  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><blockquote><p><em>The beginning of a good habit is the elimination of an excuse.</em>   <br/>
<em>And The beginning of a bad habit is the finding of an excuse</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The ability to pick on something and to make a habit of it is something that is always helpful. This skill helps to create new habits and also let go off old ones that are not doing any good to you. Part of letting of bad old habits might be creating new ones. When I wrote about <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/three_months_to_a_half_marathon/">Couch to Half Marathon</a>, some of my readers asked how to keep up with the plan. How to do &lsquo;Couch to Street&rsquo;; just getting out there.</p>

<p><a href= "https://quotefancy.com/quote/20375/Jim-Rohn-Motivation-is-what-gets-you-started-Habit-is-what-keeps-you-going">
    <img alt="Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going" src="/images/habit.jpg" class="center" />
</a></p>

<h3>How Habits Work</h3>

<p>To form new habits, it is important that we understand <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/">how habits work</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>a simple neurological loop at the core of every habit, a loop that consists of three parts: <strong>A cue, a routine and a reward.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>As Charles Duhigg points out in his book, Power Of Habits (<a href="http://amzn.to/2gOYluc">recommended read</a>) the formula for changing habits differs from habit and persons. So it is more about using a framework to understand how habits work and experimenting on changing it. Changing a habit does take time and is not an easy one, but with a process in place, it is doable with time and effort.</p>

<p><img src="/images/habit_loop.jpg" class="center" alt="Cue-Routine-Reward Habit Loop" /></p>

<p>To break a bad habit one needs to identify it first. It could be anything from spending too much time on social media, eating unhealthy food, smoking, drinking, etc. Identifying that you have a habit and it&rsquo;s not good for you to continue with it is important. You can only change something once you identify it.</p>

<p>Once you recognize the habit, find out what is the trigger for the habit. Is it a particular place, people, time, etc. It might be hard to find the specific cue that triggers the habit, so note down everything that you find applicable. Then work on to isolate the cue by monitoring the habit over a couple of days. Wire up the cue that triggers the habit to perform some other action. Create that plan in advance and have some way to remind yourself of it. If your cue is time-based or location based, then you can use your smartphone to pop-up a reminder. If not try to find ways to keep yourself reminded to perform the new plan. It feels hard in the beginning but stick to the plan, and in time you will be able to change your habit. I recommend you to read the book <a href="http://amzn.to/2gOYluc">Power of Habits</a> to understand this subject better.</p>

<h3>Mini Habits and Short Term Goals</h3>

<p>To start creating new habits, I have found setting smaller goals to target daily works better. I began writing at least one line every day to be <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/maintaining-a-blogging-schedule/">consistent in blogging</a>, running at least once a week to establish an exercise routine, eat at least one meal healthy, etc. Time-based cues help to enforce such new behavior. Setting aside a specific time as per the desired frequency to perform the activity makes sure that you do not skip doing it. Also, remember to keep the action as simple as possible so that you do not procrastinate when the time comes.</p>

<p>Like if it is running that you are planning to start it could be -  <em>Every Saturday at 6 am I will wear my running shoes and get out of my house</em>. When the time comes, this is such a simple task that you have set for yourself, and you are more likely to do it. Once you have taken the pain of putting the shoes and getting out of the couch, you are more likely to run for at least five minutes.</p>

<p>Break your goals into small and achievable mini goals. These mini goals are often referred to as <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Most Important Tasks (MIT)</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/experimenting-with-pomodoro-technique/">Big Rocks</a> etc. The key is to break them down into smaller achievable mini-goals and setting a cue to trigger the activity.</p>

<h3>Motivation and Its Role</h3>

<p>Very often we get motivated to start new activities and begin with great enthusiasm. In the beginning, we feel a spike in energy and see things happening. But soon you hit a point where you feel nothing is moving and you feel it a burden to continue. This stage is referred to as <em>plateau - a state of little or no change following a period of activity or progress.</em> You soon see your motivation levels dropping and justifying to yourself how little or no benefit your actions have. Eventually, you find yourself losing entire interest in the activity and start looking for new motivation spikes. This has happened to me many times.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Motivation is what gets you started.Habit is what keeps you going.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I have found this to be entirely true. We need the motivation to help us to get started with new activities and set new goals. But motivation alone cannot help us go all the way and achieve what we want. Before jump-starting with the idea give it a good thought to check if it is worth your time spent. If not park the idea to your <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/2010/10/what-goes-on-a-someday-maybe-list/">Someday Maybe list</a> (as referred to in <a href="http://amzn.to/2gsJaed">GTD</a>).</p>

<p>Once you have decided to pursue the idea, break it into smaller pieces and set achievable &lsquo;mini goals.&rsquo; Set dedicated time at regular intervals for achieving these mini-goals. Most important is in having some &lsquo;me time&rsquo; to get towards these goals. Like for me I have found that <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/waking-up-early-is-all-about-waking-up-to-an-alarm/">mornings work best for me</a> and created a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Morning Routine</a>. To make sure that I make the best of my time I try to work in <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/experimenting-with-pomodoro-technique/">Pomodoro&rsquo;s and inspect and adapt the process</a> often.</p>

<h3>Tracking and Feedback</h3>

<p>Tracking is an important part of habit formation. Once you have set your goals and mini habits also find ways to track your progress. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/psm-learnings/">Inspect and Adapt</a> is the fundamental principle behind Agile Processes. Habit formation is nothing but being agile, keeping the end goal in mind, adjusting the way you reach there. Find ways and tools to track progress on the habits that you are trying to form.</p>

<p>I prefer automatic tracking with least manual entry, so the tracking happens in the background. But at times you will have to resort to manual methods as well. Make sure you have a time set aside daily to capture the information. Having a review of the data obtained once every week or two and taking adjustment actions is equally important. Some of the tracking tools that I use are <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/rescue-time-track-your-time/">Rescue Time</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/three_months_to_a_half_marathon/">Garmin Forerunner 630</a> and a few manual ones. I [review my progress every week] and try to incorporate feedback into the upcoming week.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>All it takes to start a new habit is a moment - The moment where you decide on the new habit. The rest is process!</em></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/">Eating Healthy, Exercise</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/maintaining-a-blogging-schedule/">Blogging</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/waking-up-early-is-all-about-waking-up-to-an-alarm/">Waking up Early</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/experimenting-with-pomodoro-technique/">Reducing time spent on Social Media, Reading</a> and <strike><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/recording-my-first-screencast/">Creating Videos</a></strike> (looking to give this up) are some of the habits that I have formed following these techniques. The ability to decide on something and getting it to done is the most important of all. Once you have mastered the skill of forming new habits, it boils down to choosing good habits and wiring that into your life. I have heard about the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonselk/2013/04/15/habit-formation-the-21-day-myth/">21-Day rule of habit formation</a> and similar myths. But I think all it takes to start a new habit is a moment - The moment where you decide on the new habit. The rest is process!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><img src="/images/password_manager.jpg" alt ="https://pixabay.com/en/data-security-keyboard-computer-1590455/" class="center" /></p>

<p>First things first; <strong>Check if any of your accounts on the web has been compromised in the various data breaches</strong>. All you need is enter your email address in <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned</a>, and it tells you the rest.</p>

<p>My email did show up on multiple breaches, and there is nothing much that you can do about it anyways. The problem with data breaches is not confined just to the site that got breached but also with other sites if you have reused your passwords. The best that we can do is to use different passwords for each account that we create and never reuse them across sites. Also, remember to use &lsquo;stronger&rsquo; passwords. So what makes a password stronger? - <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/only-secure-password-is-one-you-cant/">The one that you cannot remember</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">Password manager</a> assists in generating, storing, and retrieving complex passwords from an encrypted database</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Password Managers allows keeping all your passwords in a single strongly encrypted location. This manager itself is protected by a password - the master password!. The master password is the only password that you need to remember, so make sure you <a href="https://support.1password.com/strong-master-password/">get this really strong</a>!</p>

<p>There are different <a href="http://au.pcmag.com/password-managers-products/4524/guide/the-best-password-managers-of-2017">password managers</a> out there, both paid and free. Personally, I use <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> and love the experience that it has across all my devices. Initially, I was worried to have my passwords (password since I was mostly reusing the same one) on a cloud store with an external service. But with all these data breaches that I was part of and having realized that not having one is worse than having it in the cloud. <em><a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-managers-dont-have-to-be-perfect-they-just-have-to-be-better-than-not-having-one/">Password managers don&rsquo;t have to be perfect, they just have to be better than not having one</a></em>. Having a password manager does not prevent your from being part of data breaches, but at least it protects your accounts elsewhere as you have not reused the password.</p>

<p>So if you still remember your passwords or reuse them, go set yourself up with a password manager!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><img src="/images/todoist_templates.png" alt="Todoist Templates" class="center" /></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.todoist.com/2015/11/19/new-way-to-create-todoist-templates/">Todoist Templates</a> is a simple way to create tasks for any of your recurring activities. Be it blogging, cooking, or any of your activities. With Todoist Templates, you can turn any project into a checklist that you can easily duplicate later. I have been using <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/todoist-manage-your-todo-list/">Todoist</a> for a long time and find it useful to keep track of tasks (both personal and at work)</p>

<h4><strong>Problem</strong></h4>

<p>I <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/experimenting-with-pomodoro-technique/">plan my tasks</a> for the upcoming week on Sunday morning. I pull in tasks for the upcoming week, and some of these tasks are template based. For e.g. for writing a blog post, I have the below template</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>TYPE,CONTENT,PRIORITY,INDENT,AUTHOR,RESPONSIBLE,DATE,DATE_LANG,TIMEZONE
</span><span class='line'>task,Blog: BlogTopic,4,1,Rahul (3565260),,,en,Australia/Melbourne
</span><span class='line'>task,BlogTopic: Draft Body,4,2,Rahul (3565260),,today,en,Australia/Melbourne
</span><span class='line'>task,BlogTopic: Refine Body,4,2,Rahul (3565260),,today,en,Australia/Melbourne
</span><span class='line'>task,BlogTopic: Intro and Conclusion,4,2,Rahul (3565260),,tomorrow,en,Australia/Melbourne
</span><span class='line'>task,&quot;BlogTopic: Images, Proof Read and Publish&quot;,4,2,Rahul (3565260),,tomorrow,en,Australia/Melbourne
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The dates on the template are relative to the day that you import the template in Todoist. So if I pull in the template on a Sunday, the tasks will start on Sunday. This is not something that I want; I want them to start on a Monday. Alternatively, I can update the template to start from tomorrow. Even in that case, I will always have to know the exact start day relative to the day that I intend to pull in. I usually plan for the tasks on a Sunday but still, like the flexibility to pull in tasks any day of the week.</p>

<h3>Todoist Template Transformer</h3>

<p>The Todoist Template Transformer takes in a date and template path and adjusts all tasks in the template to start relative to the passed in date. In the above example, if I want to blog on Wednesday, I will input the Wednesday date and the template file path. The first two tasks will start on Wednesday and the third and fourth on Thursday. Running the transformer on a Sunday (07-May-2017) with the next Wednesday (10-May-2017) below is the new template</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/visual-studio-task-list-keep-track-of-your-todo-comments/" itemprop="url">Tip of the Week: Visual Studio Task List - Keep Track of Your TODO Comments</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>It often happens when coding that I skip over some part and want to come back to it at a later point in time. I leave some comments in the code so that I do not miss it. It can be a bit tricky to keep track of these comments themselves. Before pushing up the changes to <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell">master branch</a> or creating a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">Pull Request</a>, I make sure that all such comments are addressed.</p>

<p>Visual Studio comes with a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/txtwdysk(v=vs.120).aspx">Task List</a> that is handy to track such unfinished work in code. It helps track your pending work items in one place and easily navigate to it. To have a comment appear in the task list, it has to start with a defined token (TODO, HACK, UNDONE, etc.) followed by the comment.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="nf">IsInRange</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DateTime</span> <span class="n">theDateTime</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">//TODO: Implement this function</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">NotImplementedException</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><img src="/images/taskList.png" class="center" alt="Visual Studio Task List" /></p>

<blockquote><p><em>A comment in your code preceded by a comment marker and a predefined token will appear in the Task List window. For example, the above comment has three distinct parts:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>The comment marker (//)</em></li>
<li><em>The token (TODO)</em></li>
<li><em>The comment (the rest of the text)</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Visual Studio by default has TODO, HACK and UNDONE as tokens. You can modify this under Options -> Task List. New custom tokens can be added as required and used instead of the default ones.</p>

<p><img src="/images/taskList_customize.png" class="center" alt="Visual Studio, Customize Task List" /></p>

<p>When in a multi-member team you can either use custom tokens per member or append the comment with your name or feature name. The Task List provides Search feature with which you can filter the tasks created by you or for the feature you are working.</p>

<p>I try to remove all TODO comments before merging to the master branch. For tasks that need to be tracked even after a merge, I create separate work items to the project backlog (VSTS, GitHub Tasks, Jira whatever the team is using). I might still leave the TODO comment with the relevant ticket details as well for tracking.</p>

<p>The next time you leave some unfinished work for later make sure you have it tracked. Hope it helps!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><em><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview">Azure Functions</a> is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or &ldquo;functions,&rdquo; in the cloud. You can write just the code you need for the problem at hand, without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run it. Functions can make development even more productive, and you can use your development language of choice, such as C#, F#, Node.js, Python or PHP. Pay only for the time your code runs and trust Azure to scale as needed. Azure Functions lets you develop serverless applications on Microsoft Azure.</em></p>

<p>Even when developing with Azure Functions you want to keep your sensitive data protected. Like for example if the function needs to connect to a database you might want to get the connection string from <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Azure Key Vault</a>. If you are new to Azure Key Vault check out <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/azure-key-vault/">these posts to get started</a>. In this post, we will explore how we can consume objects in Azure Key Vault from an Azure Function.</p>

<p><strong>Create Azure Function App</strong>: Let&rsquo;s first create an Azure Function App from the Azure portal. Under <em>New - Compute - Function App</em> you can create a new Azure Function.</p>

<p><img src="/images/azureFunction_new.png" alt="" class="center" /></p>

<p>Enter the details of the new function app and press Create. Each function app has an associated storage account. You can choose an existing one or create a new one.</p>

<p><img src="/images/azureFunction_create.png" alt="" class="center" /></p>

<p>You can view all Azure Functions Apps in the subscription under <em>More services - Function Apps</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/azureFunction_all.png" alt="" class="center" /></p>

<p><strong>Create Function</strong>: To create a function you can create from an existing template or create a custom function. In this example, I will use a timer based function in C#.</p>

<p><img src="/images/azureFunction_createFunction.png" alt="" class="center" /></p>

<p>In the <em>run.csx</em> file add in the code for the function. The below code fetches the secret value from the Key Vault and logs it. You need to provide the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">Azure AD Application Id and secret</a> to authenticate with it. Alternatively you can also use <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/azure-key-vault-from-azure-functions-certificate-based-authentication/">certificate based authentication to authenticate with the Key Vault</a>. Make sure you add in the relevant <em>using</em> statements for the KeyVault client Azure Active Directory Authentication libraries (ADAL).</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFTTT">IFTTT</a> is a free web-based service that people use to create chains of simple conditional statements, called applets. An applet is triggered by changes that occur within other web services such as Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, or Pinterest. An applet may send an e-mail message if the user tweets using a hashtag or to copy a photo on Facebook to a user&rsquo;s archive if someone tags a user in a photo</em></p>

<p>IFTTT helps you connect the services in your life. Most of the things that you use on the web is a service. There are a <a href="https://ifttt.com/search">broad range of services</a> that are available on IFTTT that you can start using right away. Each service has a set of triggers and actions. We can create applets which wire up triggers (if this) of one service to actions (then that) of another service.</p>

<p><img alt="IFTTT" src="/images/ifttt_recipe.png" class="center" /></p>

<p>There are a lot of <a href="https://ifttt.com/discover">pre-created applets</a> available for immediate use. You can also create custom applets that wire up the triggers and actions of services of your choice. For e.g. Whenever a new item is available on my blog <a href="https://ifttt.com/feed">RSS feed</a> I <a href="https://ifttt.com/gmail">send an email</a> to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/buffer-smarter-social-sharing/">Buffer</a>. The email to Buffer triggers it to share the post to all my connected social media accounts.</p>

<p><img alt="IFTTT Recommended" src="/images/ifttt_popular.png" class="center" /></p>

<p>If you are consuming the services of IFTTT, then it is free to use. <a href="https://platform.ifttt.com/pricing">Paid plans</a> are for publishing your service and making it available for others to consume.
IFTTT also has apps for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id660944635?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifttt.ifttt&amp;utm_source=/about&amp;utm_medium=web">Android</a>. With the apps you can also use the mobile capabilities like location, messages, etc. to trigger actions.</p>

<p>Start connecting the dots between your services and get the web to work for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>If you spent a lot of time in front of a computer then <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">f.lux</a> is for you. You would have heard that using laptop or mobile just before sleep is bad. It is because of the <a href="http://www.bluelightexposed.com/">blue light</a> that digital screens emit.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>During the day, computer screens look good—they&rsquo;re designed to look like the sun. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be looking at the sun.</em></p>

<p><em>f.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer&rsquo;s display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" alt="Flux Current Setting" src="/images//flux_current.png" /></p>

<p><em>Tell f.lux what kind of lighting you have, and where you live. Then forget about it. f.lux will do the rest, automatically.</em> <br/>
f.lux adjusts the screen to the room you are in and the time of the day. You can set the lighting that the room has, and it will adjust the screen for it.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Flux Settings" src="/images//flux_settings.png" /></p>

<p>I have been using f.lux for a couple of years and had it always on(except occasionally when <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/photography-learning-to-click/">processing photos</a>). <a href="https://fluxometer.com/">f.luxometer</a> tells how much blue light f.lux removes if you are interested.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>A while back I had blogged about my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Morning Routine</a>. The routine helps set the pace for the day and in getting things done that matters to me most. During mid of December 2016, I started running once a week to get some exercise into my routine. I got interested in running and soon was running thrice a week along with some free body exercises another three days. Since this was new and exciting naturally my concentration was more on getting these done. I struggled to keep up with my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/maintaining-a-blogging-schedule/">blogging schedule</a>, failed to get a video out in the month of February and lost track of <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/2016-recap/">everything else</a> (FSharp, Reading, etc.). Though I continued to wake up <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/waking-up-early-is-all-about-waking-up-to-an-alarm/">early in the morning</a>, I could not get much done. I badly wanted to fix things up and here is what I have come up with</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>One-week sprints and setting weekly goals</li>
<li>Break the Big Rocks (or MIT&rsquo;s) into smaller tasks</li>
<li>Improve Focus using Pomodoro Technique</li>
<li>Daily Review and Weekly Review</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>One Week Sprints</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/psm-learnings/">PSM course</a> I attended in January made me realize the importance is sticking to a process. I decided to do weekly sprints for managing my personal work. I have a better estimate of how much I can get done with a shorter interval. I have blocked time on Sunday morning for my weekly planning and processing the &lsquo;In-Basket.&rsquo; The In-Basket is where anything that comes up during the week goes. Todoist has an Inbox Project to which any uncategorized items go by default. I process the inbox and move them to various categories that I have setup in Todoist. Depending on the priority things make their way into the coming week or get set to &lsquo;tentative&rsquo; dates and appropriate categories.</p>

<p><img alt = "Todoist Inbox" src="/images/pomodoro_todoist_inbox.png" /></p>

<p><em>Big Rocks</em> are tasks that matter to you the most. Identifying them is important so that you do not miss out on them. The idea is to fill your time available over the week with the Big Rocks. The rest will find its way through, just like if you were to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VNmIxkyHd8">fill a bottle with stones first and then fill it with water, sand as opposed to the other way round</a>. Big Rocks are the same as the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Most Important Tasks (MIT&rsquo;s)</a> that we saw earlier.</p>

<p>For me the biggest rock is family, and I have all of my evenings and weekends (rather any time they are awake, and I am home) blocked out for them. Over the past year, since I have written about my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Morning Routine</a> one of the MIT&rsquo;s has changed. Blogging and FSharp still stay on, but I swapped in producing videos for Github contribution. Exercise is something I have set as a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/2016-recap/">goal for 2017</a>. To keep up with my exercise goal, I <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/">run three times a week and body weight exercises for another three days</a>.</p>

<p>Every day I have roughly three hours of &lsquo;me time&rsquo; from morning 4 am - 7 am. Waking up was difficult for a while but then I realized it&rsquo;s all about <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/waking-up-early-is-all-about-waking-up-to-an-alarm/">waking up to an alarm</a>. The &lsquo;me time&rsquo; acts as the bottle into which I have to fit the Big Rocks into (if you watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VNmIxkyHd8">video above</a>). I need to optimize the things in the best way possible to fit it all in there.</p>

<h3>Pomodoro Sized Tasks</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">The Pomodoro Technique</a> is a time management technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named Pomodoro.</p>

<p>Many times in the past I have tried Pomodoro Technique on and off but was never able to stick with it. From my previous <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">Morning Routine</a> you can easily tell that I had a high-level plan on what my MIT&rsquo;s are, but did not have any specific plans or goals on what to do about them. I also left room for flexibility to choose each day to pick up things randomly. Often it happened that I took more time to blog and got a bit of time for the other MIT&rsquo;s. Though I have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YTjHWjepag">automated a lot of blogging activities</a>, writing a post often took more time. And since I was not tracking this I was always happy that I achieved some of my MIT&rsquo;s daily.</p>

<p>Once I started running things changed drastically. I struggled to keep up the with everything and concentrated on just blogging. It was because I started losing focus and started getting the feeling that it&rsquo;s too hard to fit in everything. I let this happen for over a month but was not very happy with it. Mid of February I sat down and dumped all my available time onto a paper and broke them up into Pomodoro sized intervals. So now I know how much time I have in a week for getting stuff done. I then broke down my big rocks s into smaller measurable pieces. For, e.g., with blogging, I have 4 Pomodoro of work - Creating a draft (high level), Refining the post body, Writing the introduction and conclusion and finally Adding in images, proofreading, and publishing. Similarly, I broke down publishing videos (happens throughout a month) and learning F#.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Plans are nothing; Planning is everything</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I blocked out the time for running and exercise first, then I filled in with blogging tasks, followed by videos and then with FSharp learning. I also have a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/8539430">reading goal for 2017</a> and found that I can best do that during my commute to work. Though this is not a full sized pomodoro interval, I have this tracked. Weekly Planning and Daily Review are two other activities that I have started following religiously. I do my daily planning right after my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/psm-learnings/">Daily Scrum</a> at work so that I get to capture anything work related as well.</p>

<p><img alt = "Pomodoro Plan" src="/images/pomodoro_plan.png" /></p>

<p>I was surprised how easily I could fit all of these into the time I have. Since the task breakdown above is guesstimates, I have some buffer time in my plan so that I can accommodate tasks that take more time or urgent tasks that come up during the week or the laziness that kicks in at times.</p>

<h3>Increasing Focus and Removing Distractions</h3>

<p>Social Media and emails were one of the biggest distractions for me. Even though I try to reduce the amount of time I spent for these, I often ended up taking a glance at those sites now and then. It often ended distracting and taking me completely off course from the task. I decided to stick to checking personal email only once a day and work emails twice a day. As for social networks (especially Facebook), I decided to keep that to one as well. I wanted to track this as well and see how well I was with it. I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&amp;hl=en">Loop Habit Tracker</a> app on my phone for tracking these habits.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Loop Habit Tracker" src="/images/pomodoro_habit_tracker.png" /></p>

<p>For tracking pomodoro I use <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tomighty-a-pomodoro-timer/">Tomighty, a simple Pomodoro tool</a>. It just tracks the interval and does that thing well. The Pomodoro Technique lists down different techniques to manage interruptions and distractions. Managing interruptions is particularly useful when working out of an office and using pomodoro. During the short intervals, I usually take a walk around, fill water, stretch, etc.</p>

<p>I have only been following this for three weeks. But I find this effective and hope to stick on with it for a longer time. I no longer have to spend time deciding what to do as that&rsquo;s already decided. The only thing is to do it. Having taken the reasoning part of what to do out, I find doing things is easy and I procrastinate less.  The important thing is sticking with the process and believing in it. I am sure this is going to pass as well, but for now I happy and it works for me. How do you keep yourself productive? Sound off in the comments</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I often come across functions that do multiple things. Many times such functions have a common pattern where multiple sections within the function use the same parameters for calculations. The results from these different code sections within the function are either separated by conditionals (if, switch, etc.) or combined using various arithmetic operators. The most obvious refactoring in such scenarios is to move the code sections into different functions within the same class. Having it in separate functions keeps the code readable. But on closer observation, such functions can be moved into different classes, keeping each of these code sections as the only responsibility.</p>

<h3>Identifying the Refactoring</h3>

<p>Within a function when a similar pattern of code repeats, it could be refactored into multiple classes and composed to give the same functionality. Let us take a simple example of a function where we are validating an Account object based on different criteria. The various criteria end up as conditionals within the function. This function can soon get big and difficult to manage. It also makes it harder to test. If you are adding more validations to this class over a period you are violating the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), the O in <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">SOLID</a>. Depending on the level of abstraction that we are looking at, the class also violates the Single Responsibility Principle(SRP), the S in SOLID. The function handles validations based on different criteria.</p>

<h3>The Composite Pattern</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern">Composite pattern</a> is appropriate when the client ignores the difference between the composition of objects and individual objects. The pattern helps developers to maintain the complexity of the code and also separate out class responsibilities.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly</em></p></blockquote>

<p><img alt="Composite Pattern" src="/images/composite_pattern.png" /></p>

<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>In the Account validation above, the function checks for an email and validates the format, checks for valid billing details, etc. The validations could also extend on to users attached to the account and check if there is at least one user, the user has email, phone number, etc. Each of these validations can be moved into separate classes and composed together in one class so that they are all executed when an account needs to be validated. You can see a tree like hierarchy forming here, and the actual validation is composed of all these validations</p>

<p><img alt="Account Validation hierarchy" src="/images/composite_pattern_validation.png" /></p>

<p>The actual C# code looks like this after the refactoring.</p>

<p>After the refactoring, we have separate classes for each of the validation rules. The <em>AccountValidators</em> class composes all the other validators and provides the same uniform interface for the consumers to validate an account. It calls on to all the Validators iteratively and invokes the Validate method on them. You can use Dependency Injection to inject in all validators to this class if you are not comfortable hard-wiring them. The IoC container can be setup using <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/ioc-registration-by-convention/">registration by convention</a>, which prevents the needs for explicit registration for any new validators.</p>

<p>One other worry that I have seen common when moving to such a pattern is that - <em>We now have a lot more classes. Does that not affect the performance?</em>. If you are following SOLID principles to the core and want to maintain loose coupling in your code then creating more classes is something you cannot avoid. We do not want any
<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?GodClass">God Classes</a> in our code and the first step towards it is to split them into different classes.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>If an Object Oriented language cannot handle the creation of many classes and objects then why should we be using it in the first place?</em></p>

<p>-<em><a href="https://vimeo.com/68378923">Big Object Graphs Up Front, Mark Seemann</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>The composition can be complex conditions as in the case below. For, e.g., let&rsquo;s say we need to execute a different kind of algorithm to calculate based on a property.</p>

<p>The above composition makes it easy to test the composed parts and the composition separately. It also helps keep the tests simple and easy to understand. The code is separated into maintainable classes and each criteria can be modified independently.</p>

<p>Composite Pattern is a useful technique to keep code maintainable and readable. Identifying the pattern is a bit of a challenge, but the more you see it the more familiar you will be. Hope this helps!</p>
