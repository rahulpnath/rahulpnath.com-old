  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><img class="center" alt="Azure Powershell Get-AzureRmContext" src="/images/powershell_azurermcontext.png" /></p>

<p>When accessing Key Vault using Powershell it can be a bit tricky when you have multiple subscriptions under the same account. The Key Vault cmdlets being under the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">Resource Manager (RM) mode</a> depends on the current RM Subscription. The Key Vault cmdlets enable you to manage only the key vaults under the selected subscription. To access the key vaults in other subscriptions, you need to switch the selected RM subscription.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Use <strong>Select-AzureRmSubscription</strong> to switch the selected RM subscription</em></p></blockquote>

<p> The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.profile/v2.2.0/get-azurermcontext">Get-AzureRmContext</a> returns the metadata used for RM requests. The SubscriptionId/SubscriptionName property indicates the selected subscription. Any Key Vault cmdlets (or RM cmdlets) will work based off that selected subscription. To change the selected Azure RM subscription use the Select-AzureRmSubscription cmdlet. Pass in the SubscriptionId or the Subscription Name that you wish to switch to and the RM Subscription will be set to that. To get the SubscriptionId/SubscriptionName of the subscriptions under your account use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn495302.aspx">Get-AzureSubscription</a> cmdlet.</p>

<pre><code class="` powershell"> Get-AzureRmContext
 Get-AzureRmSubscription
 Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName  "Your Subscription Name"
 Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId  a5287dad-d5a2-4060-81bc-4a06c7087e72
</code></pre>

<p> I struggled with this for some time, so hope it helps you!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><a href="http://perspecsys.com/" class="center" title="Image By Perspecsys Photos, from https://www.flickr.com/photos/111692634@N04/15855489588"><img class="center" alt="Security" src="/images\pfx_security.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>In one of my earlier posts, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/pfx-certificate-in-azure-key-vault/">PFX Certificate in Azure Key Vault</a>, we saw how to save PFX Certificate files in Key Vault as Secrets. Azure Key Vault now <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/kv/2016/09/26/get-started-with-azure-key-vault-certificates/">supports certificates as a first class citizen</a>. This means one can manage certificates as a separate entity in KeyVault. At the time of writing, Key Vault supports managing certificates using Powershell. The <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/managing-key-vault-through-azure-portal/">portal UI</a> is still to catch up on this feature. Using the Key Vault&rsquo;s certificate feature, we can create a new certificate: self-signed or signed by a supported certificate authority, import an existing certificate, retrieve the certificate with or without a private key part.</p>

<h3>Setting up the Vault</h3>

<p>With the introduction of the certificates feature, a new command line switch is added to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.keyvault/v2.2.0/set-azurermkeyvaultaccesspolicy">Set-AzureRmKeyVaultAccessPolicy</a> cmdlet <em><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.keyvault/v2.2.0/set-azurermkeyvaultaccesspolicy#PermissionsToCertificates">-PermissionToCertificates</a></em>. It supports the following values - <em>all, get, create, delete, import, list, update, deleteissuers, getissuers, listissuers, setissuers, managecontacts</em>. For a key vault created after the introduction of this feature, the property is set to <em>all</em> for the creator&rsquo;s access policy. For any vault created before the introduction of the feature, this property needs to be explicitly set to start using it.</p>

<h3>Create Certificate</h3>

<p>To create a new certificate in the vault use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.keyvault/v2.2.0/add-azurekeyvaultcertificate">Add-AzureKeyVaultCertificate</a> cmdlet. The cmdlet requires a Certificate Policy that specifies the subject name, issuer name, validity, etc.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$certificatepolicy</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nb">New-AzureKeyVaultCertificatePolicy</span>   <span class="n">-SubjectName</span> <span class="s2">&quot;CN=www.rahulpnath.com&quot;</span>   <span class="n">-IssuerName</span> <span class="n">Self</span>   <span class="n">-ValidityInMonths</span> <span class="n">12</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">Add-AzureKeyVaultCertificate</span> <span class="n">-VaultName</span> <span class="s2">&quot;VaultFromCode&quot;</span> <span class="n">-Name</span> <span class="s2">&quot;TestCertificate&quot;</span> <span class="n">-CertificatePolicy</span> <span class="nv">$certificatepolicy</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Executing the above creates a certificate in the vault with the given name. To retrieve the certificates in the key vault use the. The certificate object identifier is similar to that of Keys and Secrets as shown below. This identifier is used to identify a certificate uniquely.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>https://vaultfromcode.vault.azure.net:443/certificates/TestCertificate
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To retrieve all the certificates in a vault use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.keyvault/v2.2.0/get-azurekeyvaultcertificate">Get-AzureKeyVaultCertificate</a> cmdlet passing in the VaultName. To get details of a certificate pass in the Certificate Name as well.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Azure Key Vault, GetAzureKeyVaultCertificate" src="/images\keyvault_getazurekeyvaultcertificate.png" /></p>

<p>When creating a new certificate make sure that a Key or Secret does not exist with the same name in the vault. Azure adds in a key and secret with the same name as that of the certificate when creating a new certificate as shown in the above image. The key is required when for certificates created with non-exportable key (-<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.keyvault/v2.1.0/new-azurekeyvaultcertificatepolicy#KeyNotExportable">KeyNotExportable</a>). Non-exportable certificates do not have the private portion contained in secret. Any certificate operation requiring the private part should use the key. For consistency, the key exists for exportable certificates as well.</p>

<p>To import an existing certificate into the key vault, we can use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.keyvault/v2.1.0/import-azurekeyvaultcertificate">Import-AzureKeyVaultCertificate</a> cmdlet. The certificate file should be either PFX or PEM format.</p>

<h3>Recreate Certificate Locally from Key Vault</h3>

<p>Often we will have to recreate the certificate on the machine where the application using it is running. To create the private portion of the certificate retrieve it from the Secret, load it into a certificate collection, export and save the file locally.</p>

<h3>Delete Certificate</h3>

<p>To delete a certificate use the Remove-AzureKeyVaultCertificate cmdlet and pass in the vault name and certificate name.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>If you are the kind of person who wants to manage a list of tasks and like checking it off and moving towards a goal then this post is for you. I am a fan of the <a href="http://amzn.to/2gsJaed">Getting Things Done</a> methodology by David Allen and found the book and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=david+allen">videos</a> mind blowing. Ever since reading the book for the first time I had been searching for a tool that helps to follow the GTD process. Though the GTD process in itself is not tied to a particular tool and works well with pen and paper, I am more towards a digital medium, as that&rsquo;s where I spent most of my time. I have tried a lot of different tools, almost everything that came up when searching for to do lists.</p>

<p>Some of the key features that I was looking out of a to-do list application are</p>

<ul>
<li>Quickly Capture tasks from anywhere</li>
<li>Availability on multiple devices</li>
<li>Able to group and categorize tasks</li>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Assign date time and set reminders</li>
<li>Simplistic and easy user interface</li>
</ul>


<p><img alt="Todoist" src="/images/todoist.png" /></p>

<p><a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> is one platform that I found the best matching with my needs and have been with it for over two years. It started with a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/staying-organized-finding-a-system-to-manage-it-all/#comment-1528539219">comment by my friend on one of my posts</a>. Since then I am using Todoist. After trying for a couple of weeks, I quickly moved on to their <a href="https://todoist.com/premium">premium version</a> for the various features that it provides. Todoist has a clean and minimalistic interface and never stays in the way of getting things done. Be it the mobile app, the desktop app or the Chrome plugin; it enables easy task management. Any new task added by default goes into the Inbox which can be categorized and processed later. This processing flow fits with the process outlined in GTD. Tasks can be assigned labels and categories, set priorities, set for action on a specific date. Tasks added to one app is synced across all the apps seamlessly., enabling a smooth and consistent experience across.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Getting Things Done is tool agnostic. Tools do not matter; it is about the process. Choose any tool that works for you, for me it&rsquo;s Todoist</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Todoist had all the features that I was looking out for in a task management application. Give Todoist a try if you are looking out for a task management application. Irrespective of the tools that you use it is your ability to stick to a plan and focus on tasks that will help you reach your goal.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>With the Australia Day (and Indian Republic Day) falling on a Thursday I got a long weekend by taking the Friday off. Me, Parvathy (my wife) and Gautham (my son) decided to head off to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Tb4awz6cx6H2">Coffs Harbour</a>, which is a six-hour drive from Sydney. We started off at six, Thursday morning.</p>

<p>This was the first time Parvathy, and I was doing a road trip this long with Gautham and had no idea what to expect. Gautham was wide awake from the start of the trip till we reached Coffs Harbour. But it was all right traveling with him. The trip was also the first since he was fully toilet-trained. We did stop at 3 places on the way but were happy to do that. We stopped for breakfast at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/H72Loz9zofk">Hungry Jack&rsquo;s, Beresfield</a> and had quick burger, fries and hash brown. We continued to have this same breakfast throughout the trip, for it was fast and enabled to get on with the day quickly. Deciding, ordering and eating at a cafe is much more time-consuming. After two more stops, we reached Coffs Harbour by two in the noon. Since both me and Parvathy are trying to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/">eat healthy (since a month)</a>, we decided to keep our lunch light. Mostly we had carrots, cucumber, and some nuts. For Gautham, we usually got something on the way.</p>

<h3>Day1 (Thursday)</h3>

<p>We headed straight to Royal Palms Motor Inn and dropped our bags and quickly freshened up. The weather forecast said it would rain, but luckily there was no rain and was a pleasant climate. We headed off straight to Jetty Beach, where we spent the rest of our day. The beach was calm and had a great walk by the side of it. The sand looked like a mirror, and in the beginning, Gautham was even cautious not to break it. We enjoyed the time there and stayed there till five. After having a wash down at the beach showers, we headed back to the hotel. Gautham fell asleep the moment we got into the car. We reached the hotel and stayed in the car till seven so not to disturb his sleep. Once he woke up, we headed off to Bombay Brasserie, an Indian restaurant right next to the hotel. We usually prefer other food option while eating outside to try different cuisine. But during the trip, we stuck to Indian hotels as Gautham often ends up eating more from there, as it was similar to food at home. We had a nice tandoori platter, Nan, rice and ice-cream. By half past eight, we reached back at the hotel, had a bath and went to sleep by ten.</p>

<img alt="Jetty Beach, Coffs Harbour" src="/images/coffs_harbour_jetty_beach_toys.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Day 2 (Friday)</h3>

<p>We all slept in a bit late today and woke up by seven. Luckily Parvathy was up and ready by then. After a quick fresh up, we started off to Dorrigo. Picked up our breakfast burgers on the way and headed off straight to Dorrigo. It was just over an hours drive from the hotel and a scenic one too. Dorrigo has a <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions?&amp;">lot of attractions</a>, but we just did the <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions/skywalk-lookout">Skywalk Lookout</a>, <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions/wonga-walk">Wonga Walk</a>, <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions/walk-the-birds-boardwalk">Walk with The Birds Boardwalk</a> and <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/dorrigo/attractions/dangar-falls">Dangar Falls</a>. We spent half a day there covering all these. The lookout and the walks were superb. It was a pleasant walk in the forest as it had rained the night before. By the time we headed back, Gautham was fast asleep after having a delicious cake with cream and juice. Woolgoolga was the next stop and was around one and half hours away. By three in the evening, we hit the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1fBYqWHDnyC2">beach</a>. By five we headed back to the hotel. On the way, we drove through <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Pm7jh9nJRCM2">Emerald beach</a> to the hotel. After a quick fresh up we set out for dinner by six. We tried a different Indian restaurant today and ate to our full. By ten we hit the bed.</p>

<h3>Day 3 (Saturday)</h3>

<p>I woke up at half past five and went for a run. I <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/users/4b76cfab-734e-1658-b5e4-600759a3b066/sport-sessions/588ba8d079a46318f38e5d10">ran by the boat jetty to jetty beach and through the Coffs Coast State Park</a>. The route was scenic, and I enjoyed it.By seven I was at the hotel and got ready to checkout. We checked out by eight, grabbed a <a href="http://www.boostjuice.com.au/products">Boost smoothie</a> and burger and headed off to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/P9e9sx5eib62">Sawtell beach</a>. It was a hot day, and the sun was already up and high. We just had a quick walk by the beach side and headed straight to <a href="http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/coffs-harbour-area/nambucca-heads">Nambucca heads</a> as we wanted to spend more time there. The walk by the Nambucca river is excellent. You can see the river meeting the sea here, and it is a beautiful sight. The river is calm and up to waist height and we can easily walk. We spent around two hours there and started our way back home at around one in the noon. It is around six hours drive, and with a couple of stops along the way, we reached home by eight in the evening.</p>

<p><img alt="Nambucca Heads, Coffs Harbour" src="/images/coffs_harbour_nambucca_heads.jpg" /></p>

<p>It was a good three-day break and completely disconnected from work and social media. It was refreshing, and the drive was great too. This was our first long drive after coming to Sydney and enjoyed it.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/screenshots-with-snagit/" itemprop="url">Tip of the Week: Screenshots with Snagit</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I have been using <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html">Snagit</a> for over one and half years and been loving it. Snagit gives you a way to create and edit screenshots or record videos to show a process, provide detailed feedback, or share information with the people who need it most. It tucks away neatly to the side of your screen and is there up and ready when you want to grab a screen capture or record a quick video. The screen capture is easily triggered using keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + Alt + S by default). Once captured, it takes you to the Snagit editor where you can add a lot more details to the captured image.</p>

<p><img alt="Snagit" class="center" src="/images/snagit.gif" /></p>

<p>Some of the  features that I often use are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blur (or Redact)</strong>: Use to hide or disguise sensitive information. Often my screenshots contain sensitive content which I want to blur.</li>
<li><strong>Step</strong>: Add a series of numbers or letters to label steps or items in a capture. This feature helps in guiding a step by step process in a screenshot.</li>
<li><strong>Crop</strong>: Common feature in all image editors.</li>
<li><strong>Spotlight &amp; Magnify</strong>: Magnify, blur or dim a selected area of the picture. This feature is useful to highlight specific parts of the image.</li>
<li><strong>Callouts, Text, and Arrows</strong>: Again pretty much standard with most image editors.</li>
</ul>


<p>Snagit has been a great fit for blogging and makes creating screenshots easy. Communicating with images is much faster with these great features. If you take a lot of screenshots give <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/download/snagit/">Snagit a try</a>, you will love it!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Often when coding, I need to move pieces of code up or down. It could be a group of lines of code or an entire function that I need to shift up or down. In earlier versions of Visual Studio, I had to select the lines of code, cut them from current place, move the cursor to the desired position and paste it. That&rsquo;s a lot of keystrokes for getting a simple thing done. In the latest versions of Visual Studio (I am currently on VS2015) we can use  <strong>Alt + Up/Down</strong> to move the selection up or down. This also works for the current line without selecting it.</p>

<p><img alt="Defensive Coding" src="/images/visualstudio_moveselectedlines.gif" /></p>

<p>Hope this helps to move code around faster!</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/defensive-coding/" itemprop="url">Defensive Coding</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Often when writing code or in code review discussions it comes up - &lsquo;<em>Should I be doing a null check here?</em>.&rsquo; and we start off long discussions. Like in most cases, there is no definite answer to this. In this post let us examine some of the pros and cons of having defensive checks and how and when we can avoid it to make the code more readable.</p>

<p><img alt="Defensive Coding" src="/images/defensive_coding.jpg" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see an example to explore more. The below code aggregated details from different repository classes and returns a combined model. I have kept this simple with just three dependencies.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">PersonDetails</span> <span class="nf">GetPersonDetails</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Guid</span> <span class="n">personId</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">personRepository</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">GetPerson</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">personId</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">subscriptionPlan</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">subscriptionRepository</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">GetSubscriptionForPerson</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Email</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">billingSummary</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">billingRepository</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">GetSummary</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">subscriptionPlan</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Id</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">PersonDetails</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{...};</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you see, there are no null checks on any of the values returned from external dependencies. The code expects all calls to be successful with no exceptions - &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path">happy path</a>&rsquo; scenario.
The problem is when an error happens; the exception stack trace will look like something below.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
</span><span class='line'>at UserQuery.GetPersonDetails(Guid personId)
</span><span class='line'>  at UserQuery.Main()
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We will not be able to tell which of the values was null, making it hard to debug the error. We have to manually go through the code checking how each of the dependencies retrieves values and check which one possibly was null. Debugging takes a lot of time and might be difficult depending on the complexity of the dependencies. The advantage of the above code though is that it is readable and there is <strong><em>noise</em></strong> in the code.</p>

<h3>Extensive Defense</h3>

<p>Let us now modify the above example to see how it would be to add defensive code and check for nulls.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p> The defensive checks added for guarding against invalid values makes the code harder to read. Defensive checks are there for incoming parameters as well and validate if they are null/default value (for Guid). However when an error happens the stack trace will mention the name of the property which was null. Debugging is fast and easy and makes the exception message useful. But we don&rsquo;t want our code filled with defensive checks like this.</p>

<h3>Team Conventions and Practices</h3>

<p>Let us dig a bit deeper into why we had to put in the defensive checks in the first place. We had to check for null on <em>person</em> since the repository decided to return a null when it could not find the person given an id. Does it even make sense or add any value in returning a null reference from the repository? Unless the business works in a way that there is a high possibility of something returning null this does not add any value. Even in cases like that, we should revert to other options which we will see in a while. When most of the time we expect a person to exists, it is better for the repository to throw an exception right away that the person does not exist. If the validations and the defensive checks are performed at the boundaries, then we do not need to do a null check anymore when getting a person or any similar functions.</p>

<p>For cases where there are possibilities of a value existing or not you can resort to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/stronger-code-contracts/">Stronger Code Contracts</a>. Using the Maybe type to indicate a value might or might not be present is a good way to force defensive checks. Maybe type ensures that any consumer of the code handles the case where the object does not exist. Readability of the code also improves in this case.</p>

<p>If you have noticed in the above code when checking for null&rsquo;s, I checked the Email property for null as well. Setting up team conventions that properties cannot be null, help reduce defensive checks for it. You could use various techniques to ensure properties are not null like setting a default value for the property in the constructor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern">Null object pattern</a>, checking for null&rsquo;s when setting property values or modeling the object in a way that optional parameters are not direct properties on the object.</p>

<p>With the updated repository code and the property changes, we can rewrite the original code much similar as it was before introducing the defensive checks. The guard clauses at the start of the function, checking for the parameters is still important. Validating for input parameters helps find the problems earlier in the code stack and follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast">fail fast</a> pattern. It helps us find exactly where the null was introduced and address the issue faster. The defensive code is at the beginning of the function and can be easily skipped over while reading. If you are not that keen to write this on all functions, you can also write some helper classes which Validates a list of parameters (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/library/w5zay9db.aspx">params</a>). I prefer the explicit check and used to skipping over them when reading code.</p>

<h3>Value Objects and Defensive Coding</h3>

<p>Let us now look at other ways to improve defensive checks on properties. Modeling properties as <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/thinking-beyond-primitive-values-value-objects/">Value Objects</a> helps contain the defensive code within the property. Like in the above case where email cannot be null, the checks to make sure that it is a valid email can be within the Email class. Containing this logic in the class removes the need for the rest of the code to check for it. If an email object exists, it will be valid. It is the same with names, date ranges, money, etc. The lesser we expose primitive type properties, the less defensive code we need to write. It also removes the problems of checking <em>string.IsNullOrEmpty</em> at some places and just for nulls at others.</p>

<p>Though this is not an extensive examination of all possible cases, we have still seen some common scenarios. Defensive coding is required. It is about striking a balance and making <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/stronger-code-contracts/">code contracts stronger</a> to convey the intent. The defensive checks are within the classes responsible for the object and exist at a central place. It removes the need to check for it elsewhere in the code. This is a simple application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming">Encapsulation</a>. So the next time you check for null make sure it is where it should be!</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Getting fit is one of the goals that I have set for myself this year. I have started running since mid of December and also controlling my diet.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>DISCLAIMER!</strong> I am not a doctor or a dietitian. The below are just my personal experiences and has worked for me.

<li>Have Parvathy (my wife) support me throughout.</li>
<li>Running 1-2 times a week</li>

<p>I was around 95 kilos when I started out in December. At the time of writing, I weigh 82 kilos. Yes, I have lost 13 kilos over the past one and half months. This is the first time I have seen such drastic changes in my body, and I believe it&rsquo;s because of the strict diet more than anything. Below are the various aspects of what I have been following.</p>

<figure>
    <img alt="Before and After" src="/images/weigth_Before and After.jpg" />
    <figcaption><em>Here is the before and after.</em></figcaption>

<h3>Exercises</h3>

<p> I started with running once a week. But now I am so into it I try to run two to three times a week. I use <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/users/4b76cfab-734e-1658-b5e4-600759a3b066">Runtastic</a> to track my runs. Last week I purchased the premium plan for Runtastic and looking forward to starting one of their 10k <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/training-plans/10k">training plans</a> and <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/en/results">runtastic results</a> on days that I do not run. I use a <a href="https://www.bose.com.au/en_au/products/headphones/earphones/soundsport-in-ear-headphones-audio.html#v=soundsport_ie_headphones_ii_audio_charcoal">Bose SoundSport in-ear audio only headphones</a>  headphones (the cheapest in their range) for music during the runs. Luckily Bose was running a half price on those models when I purchased.</p>

<p> I do push-ups every day and get 150+ (25 * 6+) every day. I split this out throughout the day - 75 before I head off to work and 75 once back. I get enough time in the morning to space it at 30-minute intervals as I <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">wake up at four</a>. I plan to replace push-ups with Runtastic Results starting next week.</p>

<p> <img alt="My Running History" src="/images/weight_running.jpg" /></p>

<h3>Diet</h3>

<p>Breakfast (<em>7:30 am</em>): Green Smoothie (+ eggs on days that I run) or Avocado and eggs.
Lunch (<em>12 pm</em>): Raw vegetables (Carrot, Cucumber, spinach, kale, beetroot, corn, sprouts)
Dinner (<em>6:30 pm</em>: Wheat Dosa or Chappathi + Vegetable Curry
Snacks: Anytime I feel hungry I have one of these - Nuts (Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, etc.), Carrot, Banana and Peanut butter. Usually, I end up having just the nuts at around 10 30 in the morning.</p>

<p><img alt="Diet" src="/images/weight_diet.jpg" /></p>

<p>When eating out, I keep an eye on carbs and other junk. Try to eat grilled instead of fried. Usually, we eat out on weekends as we will be traveling places. We usually have a hearty lunch on weekends. Parvathy and I decided to have fruits for dinner on those days. I try to take fruits that contain less sugar like kiwi, berries, etc. But we do have apples, mangoes, watermelon, etc. but in moderation. The fruit choices are more driven by what&rsquo;s available at the place <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/">I live now</a>.</p>

<p>Sugar: I try my best to avoid it fully. To start with I quit tea and coffee. Believe me, I was a tea addict and I needed lots of it. It was hard, but then Parvathy quit it one day, and I got inspired by her. I still remember that last tea I took when I decided I am having no more of it. It&rsquo;s hard but doable!. I don&rsquo;t have any ice-cream, fruit juice, carbonated drinks, energy drinks, pastries, etc.</p>

<h3>Family Outings</h3>

<p>We used to spend a lot of our weekends in shopping malls till a while back. We decided to change that to more of outdoor activities. So it&rsquo;s either the beach, boating, parks, walks, etc. This has increased our general activity levels and help burn extra calories. And mostly I have &lsquo;an extra weight&rsquo; to carry around; you can tell that from the photos :). Gautham also enjoys these outdoor activities, and there&rsquo;s more for him to learn in each of those short trips. On weekdays we go for a walk after dinner, shop around for groceries, etc. and run any other errands so that we are free during weekends.</p>

<p>With the new routine, I now feel great to be back in shape. I have never been this light since a long time, and I am happy to be in clothes that I had locked up in my bags. Since the new routine takes an hour out of <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/morning_routine/">my morning routine</a> I have to optimize myself further to keep up with blogging, videos and learning new things. I am still trying to find a balance but for this. Hoping to continue with this new routine.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><img alt="Visual Studio Quick Launch" src="/images/visualstudio_quicklaunch.png" /></p>

<p>As a .NET developer, I spent the majority of my time in Visual Studio. Knowing to navigate fast within the IDE or quickly find what I want is important. Many times finding specific settings or navigating to individual windows can take a while, especially if you are not familiar with it and don&rsquo;t know exactly where to look. Visual Studio has a quick launch toolbar that is designed exactly for this. Be it opening the Package Manager Console or changing the font style you can use the quick launch to search and navigate to it.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>You can use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh417697.aspx">Quick Launch</a> to quickly search and execute actions for IDE assets such as options, templates, menus. You can&rsquo;t use Quick Launch to search for code and symbols. The Quick Launch search box is located at the top-right corner of the menu bar and is accessible by choosing the <strong>Ctrl+Q</strong> keys.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The added advantage is that you can use the quick launch bar to <strong><em>learn new keyboard shortcuts</em></strong>. Searching for an item also shows the keyboard shortcut for it next to it. Over time you can remember the direct keyboard shortcut and avoid quick launch as well.</p>

<p><img alt="Visual Studio Quick Launch learn keyboard shortcuts" src="/images/visualstudio_quicklaunch_keyboardShortcuts.png" /></p>

<p>Knowing the tools that you use is an important part of development. Able to navigate fast within the IDE enables to remove any time wasted poking around the IDE. Use that time to read and write code.</p>
