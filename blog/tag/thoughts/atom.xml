    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Reading is inevitable to keep up to date with the latest technologies and rapid changes happening in the programming world. But technology is nothing but a tool for getting things done. What one has to understand are the concepts and principles underlying these technology and the core principles of development. These are to be gained through <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/an-enterprise-it-project-experience/">our own experiences</a> and also from the learnings and the experiences of others. Books are a great source of such experiences, and this post is a list of those that I have found interesting and helpful. I have not read all these nor was I able to fully understand whatever I have. These books are to be read/referred to multiple times, practiced and adopted into our work. It&rsquo;s also worth referring other books from the same author&rsquo;s or other writings as they are among the pioneers in our industry.</p>

<p>The books would speak for themselves and I don&rsquo;t think I can do justice writing a summary to any of these. So I have decided to just list them down here(in no specific order). It&rsquo;s worth having a personal copy of each one of these in your bookshelves. (mine is still short of some of them).</p>

<p>Hope you start of this year off with some nice readings and gift yourself with some these master pieces. I am sure that I have not covered all of them and there are still more to be &lsquo;chewed and digested&rsquo;. Do drop in with a comment on Which books have helped you be better in programming.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/stars-do-count/"/>
    <updated>2011-02-17T12:03:58+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/stars-do-count</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For all those who are wondering what this stars are,please go through my first <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/do-stars-count/">post</a> on this.</p>

<p>Casually browsing through my mails today morning,I found a mail with the subject stating,&lsquo;<em>Your online community contributions have been recognized by Microsoft</em>&rsquo;,informing me that I have won the Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoftcommunitycontributor.com/">Community Contributor Award</a>.Really excited to have the first award for a technical contribution,and that too from Microsoft.</p>

<p><img src="/mcca_rahulpnath.png" alt="Microsoft Community Contributor Award Certificate for Rahul P Nath" /></p>

<p>I appreciate Microsoft for promoting community contributors and rewarding them.Personally,I enjoy contributing in communities as I find it one another way to learn.I used not just reply to questions that I knew,but often ended up creating a sample application and finding out the solution first,which has helped me a lot in learning.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Microsoft and all the community members and people who would  have nominated me for this award.</p>

<p>Stars Do Count sometimes :)</p>

<p>edit: The award would be retired as now I am an Microsoft employee.I had intimated them on this ,as I guess somehow their records missed that I am their employee :).So got the mail confirmation today..award is retired .Still it&rsquo;s a good feeling in having achieved it at the first place.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/attachments-in-email-a-new-way/"/>
    <updated>2010-11-25T08:10:24+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/attachments-in-email-a-new-way</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a though on a new mail attachment way :).</p>

<p>What if we could attach existing attachments in our mailbox to new mails that we want to send.Forwarding the mail that had the attachment might not be a good solution in many a cases.</p>

<p>The key point here is that attachments should be like a resource,that can be shared across mails,that can be deleted edited or updated.</p>

<p>There could be a small widget showing all attachments that you have in your mailbox,from which you can add whatever you want to your current mail.</p>

<p>I think this would be a cool feature in the present email system.</p>

<p>You would not end up uploading the same file again and again :)</p>

<p>Feel free to comment on this idea ::)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I was migrating my blogs on to wordpress,I just went through all my previous posts.It seems all my posts are just a brief overview ,very brief indeed,on various topics and promising detailed posts in due time.But nothing detailed ever turned up.I guess I have to stick on to the promises and start writing blogs in detail,explore things in detail.</p>

<p>Not this post but&hellip;aaaahh&hellip;.procrastination!!!!!</p>

<p>No definitely not  (atleast to keep myself happy ;)).</p>

<p>But definitely the next post.</p>

<p>Ps: And it feels better to use wordpress :)</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/seek-the-problem-not-the-solution/"/>
    <updated>2010-07-07T06:14:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/seek-the-problem-not-the-solution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s not uncommon to have problems in life, and so in the application/code that you write. I am not being too techie here.
It’s just I am relating my thoughts to something technical.
Being a software engineer, writing code is inevitable in my day-to-day life and so comes bugs :)
I spend  a lot of time sitting on to solve bugs(of late it’s been eating away  my head) and so do I see people  around me,  at my workplace, doing the same.</p>

<p>I always go in seek of the problem that caused the bug, rather than to find a solution for the bug.
Certain others go in seek of the solution for the bug, rather than the problem that caused the bug.
So am I not saying the same thing in two different ways….solving the bug!!!!
But they are not…at least for me :)</p>

<p>Seeking for the problem gives you the solution for the bug and also a better understanding of the code that you have written. You seek for the problem because  you feel the mistake is at your part, maybe a implementation one or a logical one.
Seeking for the solution too solves the bug but does  not give you  a better understanding of that you have done. Mostly the solution might be a workaround to cover up some of your own mistakes, which went unnoticed, as you were too concerned of the solution for the bug and not  the problem for the bug. This might really not solve the bug too, it might just be a temporary fix or a specific scenario fix.</p>

<p>This is just an example.
Same goes in the day to day life. Whenever you go in seek for solutions you are actually creating more problems for yourself.
Maybe a real life example(non technical :)) would do good.
Say you are a spendthrift and you keep spending away all what  you get.
Need money urgently?? Solution is to borrow from your friend. Does it really solve the problem??
Nope !! The problem here is that you are spendthrift. So try to change that and not keep borrowing :).</p>

<p>Don’t be happy with the solution, hunt down the  problem.
Happy hunting :)</p>
