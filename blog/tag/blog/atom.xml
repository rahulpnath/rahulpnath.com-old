    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been almost an year since I have moved to this custom hosted blog and is nearing its renewal with my current host, Godaddy. Now that Azure has full support for Web Sites which enables you to deploy web applications on a scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure and being a FTE(Full Time Employee), I have the privilege of a free <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-b/">msdn account that offers 150$ free credit on azure</a>, I have decided on to move to Azure for my blog. You could also try this with <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/">a free Azure trial that offers you 200$ credit for all the services</a></p>

<p><strong>Setting up Wordpress</strong> on Azure is very easy and is just a matter of few clicks from the <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com">Management Portal</a>. You can find the detailed steps to get this done <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-php-web-site-gallery/">here</a>. By default Azure Web Sites are installed in the root directory of IIS. To move this into a sub-folder of your choice, you can use any FTP client(FileZilla). The connection details can be obtained from the Management Portal as shown in the below screen shot.</p>

<p><img src="/PortalQuickglance.jpg" alt="Portal Quick glance" /> <img src="/PortalQuickglance1.jpg" alt="Portal Quick glance 1" /></p>

<p><strong>Mapping your custom domain </strong>to the new wordpress site is about adding a <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-custom-domain-name/">CName record for awverify or www</a> in your Domain dashboard provided by the domain registrar. Once you have the required CName entries you can map the custom domain in the portal using the ‘Manage Domains’ option.</p>

<p><img src="/CustomDomain.jpg" alt="Custom Domain" /></p>

<p><strong>Restoring your content </strong>from my current host was easy as I am using <a href="http://vaultpress.com">Vaultpress</a> for my site backup and it provides an option to <a href="http://help.vaultpress.com/restore-to-a-new-site/">backup to a different web site too</a>. If not you could also use <a href="http://www.davebost.com/2013/07/11/moving-a-wordpress-blog-to-windows-azure-transferring-your-content">FTP to move your current site content which is detailed out here</a>. Once the content is restored you would need to update the Wordpress Url and Site address url in the General Settings of your blog dashboard. You could also update this directly on the MySQL database in the <em>wp_options</em> table(<em>home</em> and <em>siteurl</em> property). To connect to the database you would get the connection string details from the portal and you can use <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a> to connect to it. You might have to recheck your permalink setting on the Wordpress dashboard to ensure that it is the same as you were using earlier.</p>

<p><img src="/AzureGeneralSettings.jpg" alt="General Settings" /></p>

<p>Now you are up an running your blog on Azure!!</p>

<p><strong>Things to look out for:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1</strong>. Make sure that all your blog links use your custom domain and not <yourdomain>.azurewebsite.net.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>. I had my Jetpack commenting system broken as I had moved the blog to a subdirectory. To correct this you would need to disconnect jetpack from the wordpress account and reconnect it. You can do this from the Wordpress dashboard. If reconnecting throws some error, then connect to your SQL database and delete of the entries that starts with jetpack in the <em>wp_options</em> table.(Make sure you have a db backup before you do this). Reconnecting after that should work fine</p>

<p><strong>3. </strong>If you see any error indicating there is a Redirect loop error, this is mostly because you would be redirecting a no-www request to the www sub domain. In this case make sure that the siteurl and home property in wp_options table also has www in the urls. Otherwise it will keep redirecting itself between no-www and www creating a redirect loop.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:
4. </strong>If you face any error while trying to connect to the azure hosted web site from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=8621">Windows Live Writer</a>(WLW), this most likely is because it uses <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support">xmlrpc.php</a> for publishing posts to the site and this is accessed over the https enpoint. Since https is not setup for the custom domain, accessing xmlrpc.php over https would present you with the below certificate error.</p>

<p><img src="/wlw_https_error.jpg" alt="Https error" /></p>

<p>You could either configure your ssl bindings in azure portal, under the <a href="http://ruslany.net/2013/07/how-to-setup-ip-ssl-on-windows-azure-web-sites/">Configure tab under your website</a>. SSL bindings to custom domains can only be used in Basic or Standard mode. If yours is not in basic or standard mode as mine, you can workaround this by either configuring the blog in WLW using your *.azurewebsites.net url.</p>

<p><strong>Azure Plans &amp; Pricing</strong></p>

<p>If you do not have a free account, you might be thinking of the costs that would be really incurred for you to move on to Azure. In short Azure Web Sites is offered in four tiers: <strong>Free</strong>, <strong>Shared (Preview)</strong>, <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Standard</strong>. The pricing details for each of these is available in detail <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/web-sites/">here</a>. To have a custom domain name mapping you would at least need to choose Shared mode. For more information on how to choose the right plan for you, Scott Hanselman has a very good article on <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PennyPinchingInTheCloudWhenDoAzureWebsitesMakeSense.aspx">Penny Pinching in the cloud.</a></p>

<p>Do you plan to move to Azure Web Sites some time soon?

    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/get-started-with-your-blog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are a programmer and don’t have a blog, then there is no better time than now to start one. <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/HanselminutesOn9/Hanselminutes-on-9-Social-Networking-for-Developers-Part-1-Every-Developer-Needs-a-Blog">Every developer should have a blog</a>, for a very simple reason – <strong>Otherwise all your work is just going wasted!.</strong> I can bet that the best of your code or ideas would either be in some old email that you hardly have access to or archived or in some backup hard-disk waiting to be formatted or already formatted and all gone. All the thought, research and creativity that you would have spent would be lying just wasted and with little or no use. Having an online presence has really become a necessity in today&rsquo;s connected world, and a blog is the best place to show your presence. I started off answering <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/stars-do-count/">mdsn forums</a> and then figured that most of the people had similar questions and I was giving the same answers many a times, which gave me the thought of blogging answers and posting links to them. So anytime someone asks you something or you do something awesome blog it, so that your work does not get wasted and more people would find it useful. As with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming">rule of three</a>) for refactoring, with blogging it’s just rule of one – <em><strong>blog it always </strong>(</em>even this blog is because some one asked me after I recently moved on to a self hosted blog<em>).</em>
I have had a taste of blogspot and WordPress blog web hosting service,  before moving on to a self-hosted blog here. I think you would have guessed which one I would suggest you to get if you are starting your blog – a self hosted one. Indeed there is some effort that goes in to maintain the blog, but its worth every effort that you put.</p>

<p>I use WordPress as the blogging software and am running it on a Linux server (had to change over from windows, as there were a lot of compatibility issues that I faced). WordPress is a very popular blogging engine and so has an immense collection of themes, plug-in and add-on that are available to enhance yours and your readers experience. Once you get your wordpress installed on your self hosted domain, which should be as easy as clicking a button, install the below plugin’s.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first thing would be to <strong>connect with </strong><a href="http://jetpack.me/"><strong>jetpack</strong></a>. This would give you a lot of features including stats, social integration, publicize options and many more.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect with <a href="http://akismet.com/"><strong>akismet</strong></a> using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">plug-in</a> for preventing/moderating spam comments. Akismet provides a free subscription for personal users.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://feedburner.google.com/"><strong>Claim your feed</strong></a> and put it on your blog. You can again use a <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/feedburner-form/">feedburner-form</a> if you want.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate with<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"><strong>Google analytics</strong></a>, if you want more detailed statistics than the one provided with jetpack. Once you get your code, you can use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/googleanalytics/">plug-in</a> to integrate with your site. This will add the necessary code in all your pages header.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you have a <strong>backup plan</strong>, as you would not want all your data to vanish off if something happens with the hosting server. You could either use vaultpress or use freely available plug-in to back up to popular cloud storage like Dropbox, Skydrive or Google drive.</p></li>
<li><p>Get a <strong>good theme</strong> for your blog, there a lot of free and paid ones out there.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now that you have most of the things setup, it’s time for you to put up your first page, <a href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/about/">About me</a>. This is very important as it gives a sense of credibility to your readers, so make sure you have one. For creating content on to your blog, you can either use the online editor or use some offline editor. Personally I use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=8621">Windows live writer</a>. I love using this and all my blogs are written using this. The one plug-in that you would want to get, if you are a developer is <a href="http://precode.codeplex.com/">PreCode</a>, which makes inserting code really easy.
There are a lot more things that your blog would need, you would soon find that out and when you do, please leave a note of it in the comments section below. Happy Blogging!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Couple of people were asking about getting started with a free blog. <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> or <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> would be a very good option to start with. Personally I used Wordpress as I felt that better. The advantage with tumblr over wordpress is that you can <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_domains">link your custom domain name with tumblr for free</a> while <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/map-existing-domain/">worpress charges for linking a custom domain</a>. (You would need to pay for the custom domain in either cases). But then I ended up hosting all myself after moving away from Wordpress.com.</p>
