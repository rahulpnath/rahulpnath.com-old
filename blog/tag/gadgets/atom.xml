Of all the mobiles I have used till date this one goes top on my rating.With its elegant design,built quality and power packed features,the N95 8GB was worth every penny spent.8GB was not much of an attraction though, but definitely it being internal memory,boosted the performance.No longer I felt the time lag in apps opening,as in the previous models of Nokia.<br/>
Though its been a long time this big monster has been released it demands this piece of space here. <br/>
Not going into the specs of the phone,for there are sites which gives them in and out like this one <a href="http://www.phonearena.com/htmls/Nokia-N95-8GB-phone-p_2344.html">here</a>.<br/>
The 5 mega pixel camera is definitely a lookout feature,for you no more need a dedicated camera,if all you want is a snap of the moment.<br/>
The two way slide feature with dedicated music keys makes it to be on the race with pmp&rsquo;s out in the store,with the battery lasting pretty enough for an average music lover.<br/>
With the wide range of apps available for the symbian os , this definitely was the king of its times&hellip;..Nokia N95 8GB</p>

<p><strong>edit: </strong><a href="http://n95-download.xhost.ro/?p=4">here </a>goes a list of must have apps in the n95</p>

With all banks stopping on EMI(Equated Monthly Installment),with recession at its high,I was left with no choice for a long time,but to depend on internet cafe&rsquo;s,as my compaq V2624TU got some hardware problems and wouldn&rsquo;t start up.Blogging was on the verge of stopping&hellip;..thanks to my brother,Sagar,who turned my new banker for the brand new HP DV4.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot bro :)</p>

<p>Got to start saving though,for always bankers might not be there nor will EMI&rsquo;s(they really helped for my previous purchases).<br/>
Hoping to make it a resolution(you always want something&rsquo;s to be broken),for the year 2010.</p>

<p>Happy New Year :)</p>
